<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
<b>1) Sometimes I read SMPlayer, others MPlayer, what are they? are they
the same?</b>
<p>
No, they are two different applications. MPlayer is a multimedia player
developed initially for linux and then ported to other OS. It's very
good, it plays almost every everything, and it has for instance a lot of
filters and so on. But most users may find it hard to use it. 
<p>
Fortunately MPlayer can work together with another application (the
video window can be embedded in the other application GUI, it obeys
commands sent by the application).
So SMPlayer is just a front-end which uses MPlayer to actually play the
videos.
<p>
SMPlayer is the window you see, the menus, the preferences dialog...
(along with other things you don't see, like functions to control
MPlayer). But SMPlayer knows nothing about playing files. It doesn't
even know what a codec is.
MPlayer on the other hand, opens the files, decodes them, displays the
video and plays the audio. Subtitles are also read, parsed and displayed
on screen by MPlayer.

<p>
<b>2) DVD menus, where are they?</b>
<p>
Currently MPlayer doesn't support DVD menus... 
Well, in fact it does if compiled with dvdnav support. The last time I
tested it, it didn't work quite well. 

Anyway, even there are no DVD menus, you can still select your desired
title, chapter, audio track, subtitles... in the SMPlayer menus.

<p>
<b>3) Output drivers (directx, xv, x11, gl, alsa, oss...) what are they?
Which one is the best?</b>
<p>
MPlayer has several output drivers, for video and sound. SMPlayer allows
you to select the one you want among all of them (Preferences->General).
<p>
For video it's recommended that you use xv (linux) or directx (windows).
They use hardware acceleration and give the best performance.

The inconvenience about directx for Windows Vista users is that it
disables Aero. 
<p>
x11 and directx:noaccel are drivers without hardware acceleration. They
give the worst performance. Moreover directx:noaccel gives a bad quality
in fullscreen mode.
<p>
gl and gl2 will use 3D acceleration from the graphic card. They will
give better performance than directx:noaccel and x11 but no so much as
directx or xv. gl/gl2 can be useful for Windows Vista users.
<p>
For sound, you should usually use oss or alsa in linux. I don't like esd
or arts, they use to use more CPU.
<p>
In windows the sound drivers are dsound and win32. I read that dsound
can cause sometimes audio-video sync problems. If you notice that
problem try win32 instead.
<p>
Other drivers allows you to save the video as image files or write the
sound to the disk. These drivers are not officially supported by
SMPlayer. Use them only if you know what you're doing.

<p>
<b>4) I have a NVidia card and gl/gl2 doesn't work, why?</b>
<p>
It seems to be a problem with the NVidia cards or their drivers on
Windows. gl/gl2 does work when using the real MPlayer window, but not
when the video is embedded in another application. There's no known fix.
The only thing you can do is either use directx instead of gl/gl2 or
check the option to use the MPlayer window in Preferences->Advanced.

<p>
<b>5)</b> (old question, deleted)

<p>
<b>6) I try to make a screenshot but the option is disabled, why?</b>
<p>
You didn't choose a folder for storing the screenshots. Do it in
Preferences->General, and the screenshot option will be enabled.

<p>
<b>7) I try to change the audio track but it doesn't work, the audio
remains the same. I have to stop the video and play it again to actually
change audio. Why?</b>
<p>
With some formats (ike mp4 or ogm), MPlayer can't change the audio track
at runtime. By unchecking the option "Fast audio track switching" you'll
be able to change the audio in those formats.

<p>
<b>8) How can I change the key shortcuts?</b>
<p>
Preferences->Keyboard and mouse. You'll be able to change most key shortcuts.

<p>
<b>9) I've read something about Qt, what's that?</b>
<p>
SMPlayer is being developed by using Qt, which is a C++ library that
allows cross-platform development. The same source code can be compiled
on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

<p>
<b>10) With some video formats I only get audio, but not video. Why? Do
I need some codecs?</b>
<p>
MPlayer can player most common formats "out of the box". But for codecs
that haven't been yet implemented natively, it's necessary to install a
package with binary codecs. You can get it from the
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html">MPlayer download
page</a>.

<p> 
On Windows, install the codecs in the mplayer/codecs subdirectory.
On linux distros the package may be available as a regular package,
maybe with the name of w32codecs or something like that.

<p>
<b>11) What's the difference between Open->Close and Open->Quit? Do they
do the same?</b>
<p>
If the option "Show icon in system tray" (in menu Options) is not
checked, then yes, the two options do the same: quit the application.
<p>
But if that option is enabled, then Open->Close will just hide the
application (and stop the current file), but SMPlayer is still running.
Open->Quit really quits the application, no matter if the system tray
icon is enabled or not.

<p>
<b>12) How can I play an audio CD?</b>
<p>
Support for audio CDs was added in version 0.5.18.
<p>
Under Windows it's not possible to play audio CDs yet.

<p>
<b>13) Where is the bookmark?</b>
<p>
Not implemented yet.

<p>
<b>14) I try to play a file but nothing happens. Why?</b>
<p>
Probably MPlayer couldn't play the file. Open the mplayer log
(Options->View logs->mplayer), you'll probably find an error message in
the latest lines.
<p>
On Windows is quite common that some MPlayer builds fail because they
have been compiled with no support for some feature that SMPlayer tries
to use. The error message could give you a clue. If it complains about
cache, try disabling the cache in Preferences->Performance. If it
complains about fontconfig try to use a ttf font instead of a system
font.

<p>
<b>15) When I open the preferences dialog for first time it takes some
secs to show, why?</b>
<p>
In that moment SMPlayer calls MPlayer to get some info from it (the
output drivers, for instance). It happens the same with Options->View
info and properties.

<p>
<b>16) There's a video equalizer, but why isn't there an audio equalizer?</b>
<p>
The video equalizer was easy to do because MPlayer has slave commands to
change brightness, contrast and so on at runtime. But I'm afraid it
doesn't have similar commands for audio, so this can't be done. 

<p>
<b>17) Are you going to add support for TV?</b>
<p>
That would be nice, but TV support is not planned for now. First,
currently I don't have a TV card, and second, MPlayer in Windows has no
support for TV, so I prefer to focus on features that work on both OS.

<p>
<b>18) A lot of menu options make the video to go blank for a moment.
Why?</b>
<p>
Some options require to stop the MPlayer process and start it again with
new parameters. That's why playing interrupts for a moment.

<p>
<b>19)</b> (old question, deleted)

<p>
<b>20) SMPlayer crashed, but the audio didn't stop, why?</b>
<p>
SMPlayer crashed, but MPlayer is still running. Kill the MPlayer process
in the task manager.
<p>
Anyway if SMPlayer crashes, it's a serious bug that should be fixed.
Report it.

<p>
<b>21) The option to play a VCD is disabled, why?</b>
<p>
This option is disabled in Windows because MPlayer in Windows doesn't
support VCDs yet. But you can still play the videos in the disc, with
Open->File, and then playing the *.dat files you'll see in the disc.
<p>
<b>Update:</b> VCDs can now be played on Windows too.

<p>
<b>22) When I'm playing a playlist, when a file ends SMPlayer doesn't
play the next file automatically, why?</b>
<p>
Probably your MPlayer is translated into another language. SMPlayer
looks for some English texts in the output of MPlayer. In this case it
looks for "Exiting... (End of file)". As MPlayer displays the messages
in another language SMPlayer fails and won't work properly.
Unfortunately the language of MPlayer can't be changed without
recompiling it. But recents versions of SMPlayer allow to change the
messages that it should look for (Preferences->Advanced->MPlayer
language).

<p>
<b>23) What version of MPlayer is recommended?</b>
<p>
SMPlayer requires at least MPlayer 1.0rc1. It hasn't been tested with
older releases, and it uses some options only available from 1.0rc1,
like <i>-vf screenshot</i> or <i>-ass</i>. If you use an older version and 
see that something doesn't work as it should, before reporting a bug I 
suggest to update MPlayer.
<p>
Anyway I recommend to use a MPlayer from SVN. There are several things that
have been improved from version 1.0rc1. For instance now you can change
the audio language in avi files, seeking works better in flv and ogm
(and maybe other formats). One thing that has really been improved is
the SSA/ASS library for subtitles.
<p>
In the <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html">MPlayer
download page</a> you can get a svn tar.bz2 ready to compile. And
compiling it is very easy (in linux, I mean...)
