Version 0.6.0rc2.

This version includes some bugfixes.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc1:

 * Fix for relative paths to the mplayer binary. The problem could cause that
   smplayer couldn't play anything if a directory or file named "mplayer"
   existed in the home directory.
 * The option Play -> Repeat has been improved.
 * The selection of chapters in mkv files didn't work well if using a recent
   mplayer from svn. This has been fixed now.
 * (Windows) Bugfix: the buttons to select the font color in
   Preferences->Subtitles->SSA/ASS didn't show the color.
 * (Windows) Now the screensaver should be disabled even if protected by 
   password (tested on Windows XP).
 * (Windows) Bugfix: don't try to convert to 8.3 short names files that
   don't exist. That could cause that URLs were corrupted.
