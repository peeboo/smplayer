Version 0.6.2.

Most important changes since 0.6.1:

 * Added an audio equalizer (please read Audio_equalizer.txt).
 * Added a dialog to search and download subtitles from opensubtitles.org
   (Subtitles -> Find subtitles on the web)
 * The toolbars can be configured. The user can remove, add or change the
   order of the buttons. Right now it can only be done by editing manually
   the configuration file. A graphical editor will be added in the next
   version.
 * The single instance port can now be chosen automatically by the application.
 * Possibility to compile a portable version which (by default) won't write 
   anything outside the smplayer's folder. It won't write either anything 
   in the Windows registry. See Portable_Edition.txt for details.
 * Added the Slovenian translation.


Version 0.6.1.

Most important changes since 0.6.0 final:

 * Now compact mode resizes the window, instead of leaving black borders.
 * Added an option in Preferences->Interface which allows the user to select
   his/her preferred GUI. This way it's easier to use the mini GUI, for those
   who prefer a simpler interface with few buttons.
 * One more fix for Qt 4.4. The option FAQ in the Help menu didn't work.
 * (Windows) Fix: zoom didn't work well (black blocks appeared) if using 
   directx.
 * Added the Catalan translation.


Version 0.6.0 final.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc4:

 * (Bugfix) Two mplayer processes were run when opening a file. This could
   even make Aero in Windows Vista to be disabled.
 * Seeking with the time slider works much better.
 * Now it's possible to add directories recursively to the playlist.
 * Added a preferences dialog for the playlist.
 * The right mouse button can be configured.
 * (Linux) File managers should now display an option to enqueue files in
   the smplayer playlist.
 * (Fix) The playlist was shown for a small moment on startup. This caused
   problems if using compiz, as the window might not hide.
 * Fix for Qt 4.4, the logo didn't show.
 * Some translations have been updated (Simplified-Chinese, Italian, 
   Ukrainian, Dutch, French, Romanian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, 
   Spanish and German)
 * Now the file Install.txt contains updated info about how to compile and
   install smplayer.


Version 0.6.0rc4.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc3:

 * (Bugfix) Now DVDs start to play at chapter #1, instead of chapter #2, 
   if using mplayer 1.0rc2 or older.
 * (Fix) A delay could happen on startup if there were non local files in 
   the recent's menu.
 * (Bugfix) When using the command line options -send-action or -actions, 
   some actions like aspect_4:3 didn't work.
 * Initial support for edl files. If a file with the same name of the file 
   to play but with extension .edl (or .EDL) exists, then smplayer will load 
   it automatically. An edl file allows to skip or mute parts of the video.
 * Possibility to automatically get info (length and name) about the files 
   added to the playlist. This option is enabled by defaul on linux and
   disabled on windows (it's slow in this OS).
 * Added in Preferences->General->Video an option to select the default 
   deinterlacer.
 * Added support for the mouse's buttons XButton1 and XButton2.
 * Some new options have been added to the list of available actions for
   mouse buttons.
 * Possibility to merge the 6 seeking buttons in the GUI into only two.
   It would only show the "rewind 10 secs" and "forward 10 secs" buttons. 
   Keeping them pressed for a moment would popup menu with the rest of the 
   buttons. This option is DISABLED by default and currently it can only be 
   enabled at compile time changing the MINI_ARROW_BUTTONS define in 
   src/guiconfig.h before compiling.


Version 0.6.0rc3.

   if smplayer is not running.
 * Added new menu Video->Rotate, with options to rotate the image.
 * Added new option Play->Jump to, which will show a dialog where you can 
   enter the position (time) to jump.
 * Added two new options in the Subtitles menu: "Enable closed caption" and 
   "Forced subtitles only".
 * The software equalizer should work now with gl, gl2 and directx:noaccel.
 * Some multimedia keys should be recognized now in the shortcut editor.
 * Added help for all options in the preferences dialog.

   or finishes unexpectedly.

Version 0.6.0rc2.

This version includes some bugfixes.

Most important changes since 0.6.0rc1:

 * Fix for relative paths to the mplayer binary. The problem could cause that
   smplayer couldn't play anything if a directory or file named "mplayer"
   existed in the home directory.
 * The option Play -> Repeat has been improved.
 * The selection of chapters in mkv files didn't work well if using a recent
   mplayer from svn. This has been fixed now.
 * (Windows) Bugfix: the buttons to select the font color in
   Preferences->Subtitles->SSA/ASS didn't show the color.
 * (Windows) Now the screensaver should be disabled even if protected by 
   password (tested on Windows XP).
 * (Windows) Bugfix: don't try to convert to 8.3 short names files that
   don't exist. That could cause that URLs were corrupted.
