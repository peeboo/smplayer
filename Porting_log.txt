Porting to Qt 4 log:

Broken things:
 * ?

[b]Version 0.5.40[/b]
 * Ported the drag&drop in main window.
 * The file properties dialog was still using a Q3GroupBox. Fixed. 
   Now smplayer won't be linked anymore to the qt3support library :)
 * Ported the code to embed the playlist in the main window.
   It's not compiled by default because there are still some things to fix
   but you can try it, it works better than before (there's even an animation
   when you move the playlist to the top area). To do it change the
   value of DOCK_PLAYLIST to 1 in config.h before compiling.
 * Reduced the number of warnings when compiling with QT3_SUPPORT_WARNINGS. 
   This change is very error-prone.

[b]Version 0.5.30-qt4-0820[/b]
 * Updated the Romanian, German, Polish and Ukrainian translations.
 * Now the maximum value for volume is 100 instead of 99.
 * Ported Open->Recent files. And some fixes: now if the list is empty
   the submenu won't appear. You can also set the max. number of items in
   the list to 0 in Preferences->Interface.
 * Ported the rest of menus: audio and subtitle track selection, 
   title, chapter and angle submenus. I left this for the end for a reason:
   it was to be the hardest part and very error-prone. So test it, 
   it wouldn't be strange if there are crashes or weird things. BTW, 
   the angle submenu is completely untested (I don't have any multi-angle DVD).

[b]Version 0.5.30-qt4-0819[/b]
 * Updated the Japanese translation.
 * Undone something with submenus. I realized there's an easy way.
 * Ported Video->Denoise.
 * Ported Video->Size. Now you can add shortcuts for these options. But
   unfortunately an old problem previously fixed comes back: if you select
   an already selected option it will do nothing. That means that if you
   resize the window manually and then select Video->Size->100% it won't
   resize to the original size. I'll try to fix it in the future.
 * Ported Video->Deinterlace.
 * Ported Audio->Channels.
 * Ported Audio->Stereo mode.
 * Ported Video->Aspect ratio.
 * Added the denoise filters into the Video->Filters menu.

[b]Version 0.5.30-qt4-0818[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian translation.
 * Continuing with the boring task of porting the menus.
 * Created myactiongroup, to make easy creating menus where only one of
   the options should be checked.
 * Now the menu Options->OSD uses this new system. And the good thing is
   that options can have shortcuts.

[b]Version 0.5.30-qt4-0817[/b]
 * Updated the French translation.
 * Actions' editor: only save or load actions with a name.
 * Ported the floating control.
 * baseguiplus and defaultgui almost ported.
 * A few changes in basegui. Still a lot of work to do with the menus.

[b]Version 0.5.30-qt4-0816[/b]
 * Started to port the main window. There's a lot of things to do. Today 
   I've just made it to compile and a few other changes to make it show 
   the toolbars properly. WARNING: there might be something broken.
 * The action's editor shows now QActions, instead of Q3Actions, as the
   main window now uses QActions.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0815[/b]
 * Updated the Traditional Chinese, German, Ukrainian, Russian and
   Simplified Chinese translations.
 * The icons in File properties->Info didn't appear. Fixed.
 * Renamed the icons starting with letter "x". For example, "xnext.png" is
   now "next.png". Anyway if an icon with the new name is not found it will
   still look for an icon with the old name to keep compatibility with
   the icon's themes.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0814[/b]
 * Updated the French, German and Polish translations.
 * Changed the behavior of "Use postprocessing" and "Volume normalization"
   in Preferences->General. Previously if you check "Use postprocessing" for
   instance, then all videos will use postprocessing, no matter of the 
   setting in Video->Filter->Postprocessing. Now this specifies the
   default setting for new videos. If checked, all new videos you open
   will have the option Video->Filter->Postprocessing enabled but you 
   [b]can[/b] disable it if you want. Previously this wasn't possible.
   I think this behavior is more consistent.
 * Ported images.h/images.cpp and moved to the new resource system.
   Right now the only thing still to be ported is the main window.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0813[/b]
 * Updated the Romanian translation.
 * Added a new option for the config file: restore_pos_after_fullscreen (in
   section [Preferences]). If its value is "true" then the main window will
   save the current position on screen and restore it again when exiting
   from fullscreen mode. The default value is "true" for Windows and "false"
   for Linux. Change it if the main window moves up or down after exiting
   from fullscreen mode.
 * (By user request) Added a new option in Preferences->Interface: 
   "Remember position and size" (of the main window). Checked by default.
 * (By user request) Added two new optins in Preferences->General->Video & audio:
   "Direct rendering" and "Double buffering".

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0812[/b]
 * Updated the Japanese and French translations.
 * Trying to reduce warnings when compiling with QT3_SUPPORT_WARNINGS. 
   There's still a lot. This requires a lot of changes, simple in most of cases,
   but there's always the possibility that something could break.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0811[/b]
 * (Playlist) Ported the drag&drop. Easier than expected, less code than
   with Qt 3 and no extra code needed to support Firefox.
 * Some small changes in playlist: no alternating row colors (doesn't look
   good in Windows), bigger icons in the table.
 * So the port of the playlist is finished.
 * Internal changes in core.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0810[/b]
 * (Playlist) Using now a QTableWidget. This is the area where the items of 
   the list are shown. Please test if everything is ok (moving items, 
   selecting items, deleting selected items...).
   Still to port the drag&drop code.
 * (Windows) When changing the audio track, mplayer doesn't keep the volume 
   (it's louder). Added a workaround, smplayer will restore the volume just 
   after the change of the audio track.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0809[/b]
 * Updated the German, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian translations.
 * I started to port the playlist. Ported things: the toolbar, the actions, 
   and the popup menu. (See the "broken things" above).
   Other minor changes: Q3ValueList -> QList, Q3TextStream -> QTextStream 
   (I hope not, but there's the possibility that something has broken).
   Now the playlist is not a QMainWindow, but a QWidget (previosly I had to
   use a QMainWindow because in Qt 3 is not possible to add a toolbar 
   to a normal widget, now at last I can do what I initially wanted).
   You'll see that now the playlist looks slightly different.
   Still to port: the list view (which will be the hardest part) and 
   drag&drop.
 * Fixed a bug in the playlist. The "length" field of the items was incorrectly
   read when loaded from the config file.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0808[/b]
 * Added the updated qt_fr.qm sent by Kud Gray.
 * Now "make clean" will only delete the smplayer_*.qm files in the translation
   folder, to keep the qt_*.qm ones.
 * (Linux) Try to load first the qt_*.qm from the smplayer translation path, 
   and if that fails then try to load from the Qt translation path (previosly
   it was the opposite).
 * Ported timeslider.h, timeslider.cpp and some small changes in other files.
 * Now the moc_*.cpp files are included in the *.cpp files. This reduces the
   compilation time. In my computer, previosly it took about 2 minutes, now
   it takes 1:30. This also made me find serious mistakes in some headers.
 * Added shortcuts in the General, Drives and Performance sections in
   preferences. (Translators are gonna "love" this change...)

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0807[/b]
 * Updated the Chinese (zh_CN), Ukrainian, German, Polish and French 
   translations.
 * Removed obsolete translations in the *.ts files.
 * Compiled again without option to change style. It still causes crashes.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0804[/b]
 * Updated the German and Ukrainian translations.
 * The message "Screenshot taken..." is not displayed in the OSD if the
   video is in pause. This is to prevent that the video advances one frame.
 * Some changes in the about dialog. 
 * Changes in some ui files.
 * Added shortcuts in the Interface and Mouse sections in Preferences.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0803[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Trying to keep pause after taking a screenshot.
 * Moved options for volume from Preferences->Interface to 
   General->Video & audio (which required to redesign the Interface section).
 * Hidden the option "Use -subfont" as it seems that new SVN releases of 
   mplayer don't require it. Also that option is not documented in the manpage.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0801[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * (Windows) Added some code to prevent that the monitor turns off when
   watching a video. (Not tested yet).
 * Disabled some code in helper.cpp, as it's not needed anymore.
 * Renamed preferencesdialog2 to preferencesdialog.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0730[/b]
 * Updated the French translation.
 * Some small, but important fixes for Windows.
 * New option for command line that I think it could be very useful: -action
   This option passes the specified action to an already running instance.
   For instance, you're watching a video in smplayer, then you type:
   [i]smplayer -action pause[/i] and the video will be paused.
   [i]smplayer -action fullscreen[/i] will toggle the video to fullscreen.
   This will allow to control smplayer with a remote control.
   You can see a list of all available actions in "Preferences->Keyboard and
   mouse". Under the "Name" column in the shortcut editor you've got all 
   action's names.
   When using -action all other parameters (except ini-path) are ignored.
   So it you want to open a movie and enter in fullscreen, this is NOT valid:
   [i]smplayer movie.avi -action fullscreen[/i]
   But you can do it in two steps:
   [i]smplayer movie.avi[/i]
   [i]smplayer -action fullscreen[/i]
   The exit code will be 0 if the -action option is successful and -1 
   if there's an error.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0729[/b]
 * Updated the Polish translation.
 * Fix: if the mplayer path is a relative path, don't convert it to an
   absolute one. Otherwise smplayer may not work in external devices as
   it might not find mplayer.
 * Single instance: ported the server, and deleted old code. 
   And now changes in the server (Preferences->Interface) doesn't require 
   to restart the application.
 * Some fixes with the style stuff in Preferences->Interface. 
   BTW, it seems that changing style still crashes the app from time to 
   time, a Qt bug?

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0727[/b]
 * Updated the Japanese, Russian, German, Ukrainian and French translations.
 * Set the new option dont_change_volume to false as default, as it seems that
   mplayer in windows starts to play all videos with a very high volume.
 * If the name of the executable (without extension) is "smplayer_portable"
   then the option -ini-path will be activated (that means that smplayer 
   will look for the config file in the app path).
 * The volume icon in Preferences->Interface is hidden so the dialog is not
   so wider.
 * Some changes in the widgets of Preferences->Interface. Enabled the
   changing of style again.
 * I started to document some of the classes for doxygen.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0725[/b]
 * Properly fixed a problem with a signal.
 * Got rid of the QTextStream in myclient.cpp.
 * By user request: added a new option in Preferences->Interface: 
   Change volume on every file. If checked SMPlayer will remember the
   volume of every file, and will be restored when played again. For new
   files the default volume will be used. That was the normal behavior until
   now. The new thing is if you uncheck it. In this case SMPlayer will never
   change the volume when a file is loaded. Problem: on startup SMPlayer 
   won't know the current volume value, the volume slider will be wrong.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0724-2[/b]
 * More fixes in myclient.cpp.
 * Fix: when a video finished and a 2nd one starts to play from the playlist,
   the setting for not repainting the window background was ignored.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0724[/b]
 * Some fixes in myclient. Now uses UTF-8 to encode the texts, the timeout
   is set to 200 ms. 
   Anyway I'm not sure this is properly done. For instance if it tries to read 
   a line from the server just before sending the data, only the first line is 
   sent, the rest is lost.
 * Fix: if you don't pass any file to the 2nd instance, it won't show.
 * Fix: tray icon: it will remember again if the main window was hidden on
   startup.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0723[/b]
 * Updated the German, Polish and Ukrainian translations.
 * Started to port the network stuff (for the single instance). Implemented
   a blocking client. This makes things a lot easier. Previously this was
   done in a main window, which waited hidden until knowing if it can show
   (no other running instance) or quit. Now the connection to another instance
   is done in main.cpp with 2 or 3 lines or code, and before creating the
   main window. This is *much faster*. Now the file passed to the running
   instance starts to play almost instantaneously.
   The code (myclient.h, myclient.cpp) is quite simple and does few checks, 
   and I don't even know if it is a correctly implemented.
   I'll try to improve it (this is the first time I use QTcpSocket, and
   the 2nd time I do something relative to networking).
   There's a problem, though. For simplicity the main window always shows.
   This is a problem if you use to leave smplayer running in the system
   tray for the whole session, as when you enter in the next session the main
   window of smplayer will be visible. I'll try to fix it in the future.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0722[/b]
 * Updated the Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian translations.
 * Bug fix: exit from fullscreen when playing an audio file.
 * Bug fix: the end of file is signaling once the process has finished.
 * In the info window, not it prints the absolute file path, instead of
   the directory only.
 * Bug fix: the size of the main window might be much bigger than it should
   when playing a file passed through command line. I think this is fixed now.
   The problem was that the file begins to play when the main window
   is not shown yet. Anyway this part of the code is a mess and has to
   be fixed.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0720[/b]
 * Fix with the myprocess stuff. A connection was not made. This could
   make that the screensaver weren't turned on.
 * Some changes in mplayerwindow. Now it knows when a video starts or stops
   so it could manage clearing or not the video background. This was previously
   done in core. It also has a fix, now the video background stops repainting
   just *before* the mplayer process starts, instead of doing it when it 
   already has started. This could fix that the video window could still get 
   black sometimes.
 * Shortcut editor: the new dialog for editing key shortcuts comes back.
   The problems are not fixed, you can't enter yet keys like "Tab" but for 
   those cases I've added a button "Capture". When toggled it will try to 
   capture the shortcut (as before), otherwise you can freely edit the shortcut
   as a regular text.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0718[/b]
 * Updated the Polish and German translations.
 * Now inforeader and mplayerprocess uses the new myprocess. This is an 
   important change. MyProcess is a class which inherits from QProcess 
   (the Qt4 one, of course, although it provides some compatibility functions, 
   like addArgument(), otherwise I would have to make a lot of changes in 
   core.cpp). It provides a special working mode for Windows: the output of
   mplayer is sent to a temporary file and read from it. I hope this could
   improve performance under Windows.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0716[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, Japanese and Russian translations.
 * Started to write myprocess class. But this is done separately in a 
   testing program.
 * Fix: now reading the info about video, audio drivers, codecs and demuxers 
   is done in a language independent way (it looks for tags like 
   "ID_VIDEO_OUTPUTS" instead of English text).

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0714-1[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Tried to fix the AltGr issue but I have also realized that the Tab key
   can't be entered so I think it's best to go back definitely to the old 
   method. Retrieved the old intro text for preferences.
 * make clean deletes the file src/Makefile, as this file is generated 
   by qmake.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0713[/b]
 * Updated the German, Polish and Ukrainian translations.
 * In the action editor the AltGr key is not detected properly. So it's not
   possible to enter keys such as "#" or "@" as shortcuts. Until I fix it,
   I'm going back to the old method to enter keys.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0710[/b]
 * Updated the Russian translation.
 * Now changing a key shortcut in the actions' editor is much easier. Now you 
   double click or press enter on a shortcut (you can do it in any column)
   and a dialog will appear to ask you for the new shortcut. In this dialog
   you press the key or combination of keys that you want to assign to the
   shortcut. If you want to delete, just click on the Clear button.
   Note: this has been done by using some code from Edyuk 
   (http://www.edyuk.org)
   Note 2: it's possible that some keys are not caught properly. In that case
   report it.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0709[/b]
 * The priority option in preferences was broken. Fixed.
 * Still some changes in the action editor.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0708[/b]
 * Updated the zh_CN, German and Turkish translations.
 * Bug fix: now the info about the demuxer, audio and video codec are updated
   after a restart of the mplayer process.
 * Ported the shortcuts' editor, by using a QTableWidget instead of a Q3Table.
   This has been a very hard task (and in fact it's not completely finished 
   yet), as there are a lot of differences between Q3Table and QTableWidget. 
   Moreover QTableWidget is more prone to crashes as it requires the use of 
   pointers all around.
 * Updated the shorcuts/default.keys as the previous one lacked the action 
   "quit".

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0706-2[/b]
 * New feature: on startup smplayer will try to create two directories:
   $HOME/.smplayer and $HOME/.smplayer/screenshots
   Now the configuration file will be stored in $HOME/.smplayer/
   If you want to keep your configuration just copy 
   $HOME/.config/RVM/smplayer.ini to $HOME/.smplayer/
   And obviously the directory $HOME/.smplayer/screenshots will be 
   used to store the screenshots (this also fulfills an old request).
   This change affects also Windows! Not compiled yet on Windows but 
   according to the Qt docs the directories will be 
   C:/Documents and Settings/Username/.smplayer and
   C:/Documents and Settings/Username/.smplayer/screenshots
 * Updated the Polish translation.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0706-1[/b]
 * Started to use the new (and more complicated) method in Qt 4 for 
   retranslating the texts. While doing this I have found a bug: the vertical
   texts in the video equalizer doesn't appear when the language is Japanese,
   Chinese or Georgian (it worked with Qt 3 but it seems that it never worked
   with Qt 4). Until I find a fix, as a work around I added a tooltip
   so the user could know what's each control for.
 * The problem with texts in buttons in QDialogButtonGroups, which are not 
   retranslated, seems to be fixed in Qt 4.3. I'm still using Qt 4.2.3 so I
   added a work around for Qt 4.2.
 * Added "buddies" (or key accelerators) in the Advanced section in preferences. 
   I'm afraid this breaks the translations but it's something that has to 
   be done. I'll add them too in the other sections.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0705[/b]
 * Now the qt translation file is loaded too when the user changes the language
   in the preferences dialog (unfortunately it seems that the strings in 
   buttons are not updated at runtime, so you'll need to restart the program
   to have a full translation).
   This is what it will be done:
   First it will try to load the qt translation from the Qt translation folder, 
   if that fails then it will try to load it from the smplayer translation 
   folder. This would allow smplayer to use non official Qt translations for 
   other languages, without having to install them in the Qt directories.
   In Windows it will just look for the translations in the smplayer 
   translation folder, as most windows users won't have Qt installed.
 * Made some changes in the actions editor to avoid corruption of the key
   shortcuts. The corruption happened because the shortcuts were translated
   (for example, the shortcut "Ctrl+Right" was translated to "Ctrl+Derecha" 
   in Spanish) but when a language change occurs at runtime, the new language 
   don't understand the shortcuts. This has been fixed not allowing the 
   shortcuts to be translated.
 * Using a QDialogButtonGroup in the file properties dialog.
   The QDialogButtonBox shows the Ok, Cancel... buttons in different ways
   according to the current style. The best way to see the difference is
   to use the Cleanlooks style: smplayer -style cleanlooks
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German, Polish and Russian translations.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0704[/b]
 * Added a bat file (compile_windows.bat) to make easier the compilation in
   windows.
 * Updated the German and Japanese translations.
 * Renamed some ui files.
 * Using a QDialogButtonGroup in the about dialog.
 * Try to load the qt translation file. This way texts directly generated
   by the Qt library (ok and cancel buttons, the file dialog...) will also be 
   translated (if a translation is available for your language). Currently it
   will try to load the *.qm file from the Qt translation path 
   (querying QLibraryInfo). It should work on linux but I don't know if 
   it will work on windows.
   Note: currently the language for this translations can't be change 
   at run-time.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0703[/b]
 * Updated the German and Polish translations.
 * Some fixes with the new help window in preferences.
 * To save some space in the tar.gz, now the *.qm files won't be distributed,
   as they can be generated by lrelease. So now the Makefile will try to create
   those files. By default it will call to lrelease (which should be included
   in the Qt development package). In (k)ubuntu this tool is named lrelease-qt4,
   you can pass it to Makefile this way:
   make LRELEASE=lrelease-qt4
 * Removed the old preferences code in basegui.
 * Ported main.cpp (and removed the KDE 3 code).
 * Improved inputdvddirectory. Now using automatic connections, and a buttonbox
   for the Ok and cancel buttons (if you're using the cleanlooks style you'll
   see the difference).
 * Using automatic connections in the logwindow. So I think now all the *.ui
   files are properly ported to Qt 4.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0702-2[/b]
 * Updated the Polish translation.
 * Added the "whatsthis" help again to the preferences dialog. So now the
   preferences dialog recovers whole functionality.
 * And something new: the "help" button works. It will display all 
   "whatsthis" messages in a single page. There's not help for everything yet.
 * Moved the old preferences stuff to old-preferences directory. Now the
   old preferences dialog is not compiled any more.
   So the new preferecences dialog is mostly finished.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0702-1[/b]
 * Updated the German and Polish translations.
 * The advanced section is also available in the preferences dialog.
   So now all sections are available again. Although it looks like before,
   the preferences dialog has completely been rewritten, so there could be
   bugs. So please test it, and report if you find any problem.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0701-2[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * The performance section is now available in the preferences dialog.
 * Added the keyboard & mouse section too.
 * Added the subtitle section. And now using the new QFontComboBox to
   select the system font. BTW, I've just realized that the QFontComboBox
   was added in Qt 4.2. So that means that now SMPlayer requires at least 
   Qt 4.2.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0701-1[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German, Russian and Polish translations.
 * The interface section is available in the preferences dialog. I added this
   section first because I needed to test the language and iconset change.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0630-2[/b]
 * The first two sections (General and Drives) in the new preferences dialog
   should now be fully functional, although testing is needed. It's very
   easy that I could have forgotten to copy some code from the old dialog 
   and some options might not work as expected. So testing would be very
   appreciatted.
 * Switched to the new Qt 4 automatic connections in FilePropertiesDialog.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0630-1[/b]
 * Made InfoReader a little bit smarter. Now it calls mplayer by its own, and
   PreferencesDialog and FilePropertiesDialog ask it for the info 
   (available drivers, codecs...), so this is not done anymore by BaseGui.
 * Now the new preferences dialog is used if compiled with 
   #define NEW_PREFERENCES_DIALOG 1 (in config.h)
   Otherwise the old dialog will be used to keep things working.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0629-2[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Created the file create_deb.sh, specially for Ubunty users. If you run it,
   it would create a deb package.
 * Started to write the new preferences dialog. When finished it will look like
   the old one, but internally each section will be a separate widget, so it 
   will be easier to maintain. This new dialog is hidden, if you want to
   see it press Ctrl+6.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0629-1[/b]
 * Updated the pt_PT translation.
 * filepropertiesdialog.cpp: replaced the Q3ListBox with QListWidget. So
   this file is completely ported.
 * mplayerprocess: changed the Qt headers but still using Q3Process.
 * Ported global.h and global.cpp.
 * The link in the "about" dialog at last works (if Qt >= 4.2).
 * Fix: use setAutoFillBackground() only if Qt >= 4.1.
 * Now the option "Don't repaint the video background" is checked by default
   in linux.

[b]Version 0.5.29-qt4-0628[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian and Russian translations.
 * Ported (partially) inforeader.h and inforeader.cpp. Now using QLists
   instead of Q3ValueLists. Still using Q3Process though.
 * Ported eqslider.h, eqslider.cpp, eqsliderbase.ui, verticaltext.h,
   verticaltext.cpp, videoequalizer.h and videoequalizer.cpp. All of this is
   the video equalizer.
 * Ported seekwidget.h, seekwidget.cpp and seekwidgetbase.ui. This provides
   the widget that allows to change the seeking times in Preferences->Interface.
 * Ported preferencesdialogbase.ui and made some small changes in 
   preferencesdialog.h/preferencesdialog.cpp to make it compile. Still using
   a lot of Qt 3 widgets. This is the preferences dialog and it's huge. 
   I'll change them later because I thought about to split it in modules.
 * Ported mplayerwindow.cpp and mplayerwindow.h. This is the widget used
   for the video.

[b]Version qt4-0627[/b]
 * Updated the French translation, using the one sent by Kud Gray.
 * Ported inputdvddirectory.h, inputdvddirectory.cpp and 
   inputdvddirectorybase.ui (first ui ported, not easy to port these files...).
   This dialog appears when the user select Open->DVD from folder.
 * Ported logwindow.h, logwindow.cpp and logwindowbase.ui. This is the
   widget used to display the mplayer/smplayer logs.
 * Ported (partially) filepropertiesdialog.h, filepropertiesdialog.cpp,
   and filepropertiesdialogbase.ui. Still using Q3ListBox.
   This dialog appears with Options->View info and properties.

[b]Version qt4-0626-1[/b]
 * Updated the Polish translation.
 * Ported trackdata.h, trackdata.cpp, tracks.h, tracks.cpp, encoding.h,
   encoding.cpp, mediadata.h, mediadata.cpp, mediasettings.h, 
   mediasettings.cpp, preferences.h, preferences.cpp, recents.h, recents.cpp,
   translator.h and translator.cpp (only renamed headers needed).
 * Ported subtracks.h and subtracks.cpp. It was necessary to change a 
   Q3ValueList with QList. Don't know if this could have unexpected results.
   This class stores the subtitle tracks and it's responsible for checking if
   any of the subtitles matches the user's favourite language.

[b]Version qt4-0625-1[/b]
 * Updated the German and Polish translations.
 (Let's start with the easiest...)
 * Removed the prep section in Makefile, and the conv2qt4.sh and conv2qt4.bat
   in src/ as they won't be needed anymore.
 * Ported filedialog.h and filedialog.cpp. Removed all KDE 3 code.
   These files contains all open/save dialogs. Now using the Qt 4 dialogs,
   which are a little bit nicer (in linux).
 * Ported aboutdialog.h and aboutdialog.cpp. This is the "About SMPlayer"
   dialog. 
   Note: the link at the bottom still doesn't work.
 * Ported core.h and core.cpp. Only the Qt headers have been changed. 
   It seems no other change is required.
 * Ported infofile.h and infofile.cpp. Only the Qt headers were changed.
   This class creates the info text you can see in Options->View info and
   properties (Information tab).
 * Ported desktopinfo.h and desktopinfo.cpp. Only the Qt headers were needed
   to change.
