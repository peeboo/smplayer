This version supports mpv (http://mpv.io).

To use mpv instead of mplayer, open the smplayer preferences dialog,
and enter "mpv" instead of "mplayer" in the mplayer binary field.
Only mpv 0.6.2 has been tested, it may not work with older versions.

While the most usual functions work, there are some known problems:

* the options in the DVD menus can't be selected with the mouse. Reason:
  there's no slave command to pass the mouse position to mpv.
* the audio equalizer works, but adjusting it with the controls is not
  smooth. Reason: the slave command "af_cmdline equalizer" is missing.
* it's not possible to change the hue when using the software video
  equalizer. Reason: the hue filter is missing.
* the postprocessing filter won't work. Reason: the -autoq option
  is missing.
* the filter kerndeint won't work. Reason: this filter is missing.
  If you select it, smplayer will use yadif instead.
* Thumbnail generator. It's very slow if you select to extract png files. It
  works fine with jpg.
* Audio CD. The first title is 1 instead of 0 (as opposite to DVD or bluray).
  Track 0 and 1 plays the same track. I guess this is a bug, and I didn't
  added a workaround. That means that the last track can't be played.
* VCD and DVB haven't been tested yet.
