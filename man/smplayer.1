.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
SMPlayer is a GUI media player based on Qt 4, using \fBmplayer\fR(1) as its backend.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-minigui
Open the mini GUI instead of the default one.
.TP
.B \-defaultgui
Open the default gui.
.TP
.B \-ini\-path
Specify the directory for the configuration file (smplayer.ini).
.TP
.B \-send\-action
Try to make a connection to another running instance and send to it the
specified action. Example: \fB\-send\-action\fR pause The rest of options
(if any) will be ignored and the application will exit. It will return 0
on success or \fB\-1\fR on failure.
.TP
.B \-actions action_list
A list of actions separated by spaces. The
actions will be executed just after loading the file (if
any) in the same order you entered. For checkable actions
you can pass true or false as parameter. Example: \fB\-actions\fR
"fullscreen compact true". Quotes are necessary in case you
pass more than one action.
.TP
.B \-close\-at\-end
Close the main window when the file/playlist
finishes.
.TP
.B \-no\-close\-at\-end
Do not close the main window when the file/playlist
finishes.
.TP
.B \-fullscreen
Play the video in fullscreen mode.
.TP
.B \-no\-fullscreen
Play the video in window mode.
.TP
.B \-sub
Specify the subtitle file to be loaded.
.TP
.B \-help
Show the help message and then exit.
.TP
.B -add\-to\-playlist
If there is another instance running, the media will be
added to that instance's playlist. If there is no other
instance, this option will be ignored and the files will be
opened in a new instance.
.TP
.B media
Any kind of file that SMPlayer can open. It can be a local file,
a DVD (e.g. dvd://1), an Internet stream
(e.g. mms://....) or a local playlist in format m3u. If the
\fB\-playlist\fR option is used, that means that SMPlayer will
pass the \fB\-playlist\fR option to MPlayer, so MPlayer will
handle the playlist, not SMPlayer.
