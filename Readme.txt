SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic
features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features
like support for MPlayer filters and more.

...

Well, you've probably read the rest in the web, haven't you?

To the point:

To know how to compile and install smplayer please read INSTALL.txt.

There's available an optional package called smplayer-themes. It contains
some icon themes for smplayer and it's highly recommended that you install it 
too.

Visit http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/ for updates.
