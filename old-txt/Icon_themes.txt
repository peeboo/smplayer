From version 0.3.13 smplayer can change its icons at runtime.

In Preferences->Interface you'll find an option for changing the icon set.

In this document I'm going to explain how that option works and how you
can create your own icon set.

smplayer will look for a directory for icons. The directory may be
/usr/local/share/smplayer/icons/ or something like that. You can know it
by looking at the first lines of the smplayer log:

[code]
This is smplayer v. 0.3.13 running on Linux
Qt v. 3.3.3
 * application path: '/usr/bin'
 * data path: '/usr//share/smplayer/'
 * translation path: '/usr//share/smplayer/translations/'
 * doc path: '/usr//share/doc/packages/smplayer/'
 * icon path: '/usr//share/smplayer/icons/'
[/code]

Well, under the icons/ directory there can be other subdirectories. Each
subdirectory contains an icon set. The name of the directory will be the
name of the icon set (the name which will be shown in the Preferences
dialog).

Inside that directory there'll be the *.png files that smplayer will
load if the user choose that icon set.

To create your own icon set, just create a subdirectory under icons/
with the name you want. Inside store your icons with the same names that
they have in icons-png/ in the sources.

It's not necessary that the icons were the same size as the original
ones, but smplayer can resize some of them.

It's not necessary either that you create a replacement for all icons.
If a icon is not there, smplayer will use the default icon.

In the other hand smplayer could try to load a icon that it's not even
in the default icon set. So your icon set could even provide icons for
menu options that the default icon set doesn't have.

Currently smplayer searches for these additional icons:
