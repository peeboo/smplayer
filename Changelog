[b]Version 0.5.57[/b]
 * Fixes in the window resize code. Now resizes should be much smoother.
   Only if you do something that alter the size of the window, like moving
   a toolbar or docking the playlist, could produce some flickering if
   you later change the video size using any of the options in the menu 
   Video->Size. It also has to fix the problem that the window gets a very 
   small that happens in Windows (although I couldn't test it).
   Of course this is in linux using Qt 4.2.3. Will it work on Windows with
   Qt 4.3.1?
 * Added the action "Toggle double size" in Video->Size.

[b]Version 0.5.56[/b]
 * Updated the French translation.
 * Fixed regular expression in core.cpp to identify the DVD drive letter.
 * Rewrite the code to automatically resize the main window.
 * More fixes in the code to embed the playlist in the main window.
   Now exiting fullscreen works ok, the playlist is restored where it was
   before. There are still some minor issues.
   In my computer (linux, Qt 4.2.3) it works quite well, so I enable again
   the code by default. But... will it work on Windows and Qt 4.3.1?

[b]Version 0.5.55[/b]
 * Updated the Japanese, Polish, Ukrainian, German, Romanian and Dutch 
   translations.
 * The trailing "/" in dvd device paths will be removed again, but not
   if used with drive letters (E:/ for instance). It seems that sometimes
   it's necessary to enter the drive that way in order to play a DVD.
 * Fixed all deprecated warnings. Now smplayer can be compiled without
   QT3_SUPPORT defined. Still using deprecated signals (for instance
   for QActions) but I've got no warnings about them so it'll be
   difficult to fix unless I compile Qt with no Qt3 support at all 
   (I guess).

[b]Version 0.5.54[/b]
 * Updated the German, Ukrainian and Romanian translations.
 * Disabled again the playlist in main window as it has serious problems with
   Qt 4.3.1 (at least in Windows).
 * The trailing "/" in dvd device paths won't be removed. It seems that 
   sometimes it's necessary. But be carefully, Windows users, when playing a
   dvd from a folder in the hard disc the path shouldn't end in "/", that 
   would make mplayer to fail.
 * (By user request) Added "Video->Flip image" which flips the image 
   upside-down. This option will affect the current video only, it's not
   a global option.
 * Now you can move the toolbars wherever you want.
 * Added the option "Create index if needed" in Preferences->Performance.
   The option will pass -idx to mplayer. From mplayer manpage:
   "Rebuilds index of files if no index was found, allowing seeking.
   Useful with broken/incomplete downloads, or badly created files."

[b]Version 0.5.53[/b]
 * Some fixes in the code to add the file to play in the playlist.
 * Some more improvements on the playlist embedded in the main window: 
   now the main window resizes when the playlist is docked/undocked.
   It also remembers its state on startup.
   For first time this code will be compiled as default so other people could
   test it. Anyway there's two known issues: the main window doesn't resize
   properly when playing an audio file (no video window) and the playlist 
   is undocked (maybe another Qt 4.2.3 bug?). And to avoid some problems when
   exiting from fullscreen, the playlist is made floatable when entering in
   fullscreen mode.
   How to use it? The playlist will appear by default docked in the bottom area. 
   You can move it to the top area if you want, or make it floatable
   by dragging it outside the window. You can dock it again by dragging the
   playlist to the bottom or top areas of the main window (there's also
   a button in the title bar for this).
 * Added a help message about the option "It's a playlist" in Open->URL.

[b]Version 0.5.52[/b]
 * Updated the Russian translation.
 * Fix in the open URL dialog: the text should be selected now.
 * Fix for Qt 4.3.1 under Windows: after playing an audio file the video window
   didn't show when playing a video.
 * Experimental: add file to be opened in the playlist (deleting the whole
   playlist first). This prevents that when a file finishes, an item from an
   old playlist starts to play.
 * Added a context menu for when clicking on a toolbar.

[b]Version 0.5.51[/b]
 * Updated the Chinese (zh_CN), French, Romanian, German, Ukrainian and
   Polish translations.
 * By mistake, the new option "close when finish" was enabled by default.
   Now that option will be disabled by default.
 * (Windows) When using Qt 4.3, inforeader fails, it can't read the output
   of mplayer. That means there won't be info about the codecs, demuxers,
   output drivers... I don't know why that happens, but disabling redirection
   of the mplayer output to a temporary file makes it to work again.
   I also realized that QProcess in Qt 4.3 works much better, so it's not
   necessary to send the mplayer output to a temporary file. So now if
   compiled with Qt 4.3 it won't use temporary files, fixing the problem with
   inforeader. Still there's a problem, if compiled with Qt 4.2.3 but using
   the Qt 4.3 dll's, the problem will still be present. Unless...
 * Now inforeader uses QProcess (not myprocess), so now it shouldn't be 
   affected by the problem metioned before.
 * It doesn't try to create the app home directory ($HOME/.smplayer) if 
   -ini-path is used.

[b]Version 0.5.50[/b]
 * Updated the German, Ukrainian and Japanese translations.
 * I hope, fixed a problem with the playlist actions not showing (or
   appearing duplicated) in the actions editor. Now it works ok with Qt 4.2.3 
   but I won't be sure the problem is really fixed until I test it with Qt 4.3.
 * Added the option Subtitles->Use SSA/ASS library, to make easy to enable
   or disable the use of the ass lib without having to open the 
   preferences dialog.
 * Added new option in Preferences->General: Close when finished. If checked,
   the main window will be closed when the current file/playlist finishes.
   Now the command line option -close-at-end just will enable that option.
 * Added shortcuts in the Preferences->Subtitles dialog.

[b]Version 0.5.49[/b]
 * Updated the Polish and Ukrainian translations.
 * Fixed warnings about using deprecated setBackgroundColor.
 * Renamed command line option -action to -send-action. This option will
   try to send the specified action to another running instance of smplayer,
   after that it will quit.
 * Added a new option for command line: -actions. As opposite to -send-action,
   this option will run the actions in the same instance. There could be
   several actions, separated by spaces (and enclosed in quotes). Examples:
   [i]smplayer video.avi -actions fullscreen[/i] (the file video.avi will be
   loaded, and just after that fullscreen mode will be toggled).
   [i]smplayer video.avi -actions "extrastereo_filter on_top"[/i] (will load
   the video, and then the extrastereo filter and the stay on top options 
   will be toggled.
   "Toggled" means: if the option was previosly enabled now it will disabled
   and vice versa. If you want to be sure that an option will be on or off
   you can pass "true" or "false" as parameter:
   [i]smplayer video.avi -actions "on_top true"[/i] (the option Video->Stay on
   top will be checked, no matter the previous state).
   [i]smplayer -actions "show_language_toolbar false"[/i] (will hide the 
   language toolbar)
   Some actions are not checkable, like open_vcd, double_speed... In that case 
   you shouldn't use "true" or "false". But if you do it will be ignored.
   If you make a mistake and enter an action that doesn't exists, you'll get
   a warning (in the logs or in console) and it'll be ignored.

[b]Version 0.5.48[/b]
 * Updated the Russian and Japanese translations.
 * Now smplayer will also look for icon themes in $HOME/.smplayer/themes. 
   In the case a theme is both in the user directory and the system directory
   (usually /usr/share/smplayer/themes) it will look first in the user
   directory. If the icon is not there then it will look in the system
   directory.
 * Under linux the buttons for color selection (Preferences->Subtitles) now
   look better.

[b]Version 0.5.47[/b]
 * Updated the Russian, German, French and Romanian translations.
 * Now the helping messages (for -help) are formated automatically by a 
   function, making easy to translate these messages. I apologize for 
   yesterday's madness. As compensation I have adapted myself the translations
   I received today.
   There's nothing more new in this version, but I release it so other 
   translators don't go crazy.

[b]Version 0.5.46[/b]
 * Added the option -playlist for command line. This option should be
   prepended in front of a filename (URL or whatever). This option will make
   mplayer to treat the file as a playlist. This option has nothing to do 
   with smplayer's playlist! In fact smplayer won't have any control over
   the playlist at all. For smplayer it will just be like a single file.
 * Added the option -help for command line. It will show a helping message.
   BTW, the translators will have a challenge, as keeping the formating
   is not easy. (Take a look at the Spanish translation).
 * Added the option -close-at-end command line. The main window will be
   closed when the file/playlist finishes.

[b]Version 0.5.45[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian and German translations.
 * The playlist check in the open URL dialog works. If checked the option 
   -playlist will be added to the mplayer command line. (Internally some text
    will be appended to the URL, so smplayer can recognize it. This may seem
    ugly (and it is) but allows to add the URL to a playlist or to the recent
    files menu, and it will still work).
 * Added an icon to the open URL dialog (url_big.png).
 * Added two options for the config file: [i]enable_audiocd_on_windows[/i] and
   [i]enable_vcd_on_windows[/i]. It seems that mplayer on Windows doesn't have
   support for VCDs and Audio CDs (at least not the build supplied with 
   smplayer). Setting these options to "true" will enable the entries in the
   open menu.

[b]Version 0.5.44[/b]
 * Updated the Polish, German and French translations.
 * When trying to stop a video, the mplayer process will be killed if it
   doesn't finish within 3 seconds.
 * New dialog to enter a URL (the playlist check doesn't work yet).
 * Don't load actions from playlist to the actions' editor as it seems
   they are already there from the main window (in Qt 4.3 they appear twice).

[b]Version 0.5.43[/b]
 * Updated the Italian translation.
 * Small fix for Windows in the fullscreen code.
 * Removed the "&" characters in the description of the actions in the
   actions' editor.
 * Using less deprecated functions.

[b]Version 0.5.42[/b]
 * Serious bug: a lot of actions were missing in the actions' editor. Fixed.
 * More improvements with the playlist embedded in the main window: now it
   should be properly hidden/shown when toggling compact and fullscreen mode, 
   and when clicking on the systray icon. Also the playlist button in toolbar
   (and menu) should be updated when the playlist is closed by clicking
   on its close button. But you'll see that now the main window is not
   resized when the playlist is shown or hidden. I left this problem for the
   end (it's not trivial). Anyway you can press CTRL-1 to force a resize.
   This code is not compiled by default yet. If you want to see it, 
   change the value of DOCK_PLAYLIST to 1 in config.h before compiling.

[b]Version 0.5.41[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian and Russian translations.
 * Fixed the problem with the Video->Size menu. All options will work now
   no matter of the previous selection.
 * Some changes in Install.txt, just to mark some obsolete sections and
   make clear that it can only be compiled with Qt >= 4.2.

[b]Version 0.5.40[/b]
 * Ported to Qt 4. Easy to say but it took almost 2 months, and it's not
   completely finished yet (still using some deprecated functions).

 Some other changes since version 0.5.21 (for details read the Porting_log):

 * Now the option "Don't repaint the video background" is checked by default
   in linux.
 * Created the file create_deb.sh, specially for Ubunty users. If you run it,
   it would create a deb package.
 * Added a bat file (compile_windows.bat) to make easier the compilation in
   windows.
 * New button in the preferences dialog: Help. It will display some help
   about the options in the current section.
 * Now the configuration file will be in $HOME/.smplayer/smplayer.ini and 
   $HOME/.smplayer/screenshots will be used as the default directory to
   save the screenshots.
 * Bug fix: now the info about the demuxer, audio and video codec are updated
   after a restart of the mplayer process.
 * Fix: now reading the info about video, audio drivers, codecs and demuxers
   is done in a language independent way (it looks for tags like
   "ID_VIDEO_OUTPUTS" instead of English text).
 * Now changing a key shortcut in the actions' editor is much easier. Now you 
   double click or press enter on a shortcut (you can do it in any column)
   and a dialog will appear to ask you for the new shortcut. In this dialog
   you press the key or combination of keys that you want to assign to the
   shortcut. If you want to delete, just click on the Clear button.
   Note: this has been done by using some code from Edyuk 
   (http://www.edyuk.org)
 * By user request: added a new option in Preferences->Interface: 
   Change volume on every file. If checked SMPlayer will remember the
   volume of every file, and will be restored when played again. For new
   files the default volume will be used. That was the normal behavior until
   now. The new thing is if you uncheck it. In this case SMPlayer will never
   change the volume when a file is loaded. Problem: on startup SMPlayer 
   won't know the current volume value, the volume slider will be wrong.
 * New option for command line that I think it could be very useful: -action
   This option passes the specified action to an already running instance.
   For instance, you're watching a video in smplayer, then you type:
   [i]smplayer -action pause[/i] and the video will be paused.
   [i]smplayer -action fullscreen[/i] will toggle the video to fullscreen.
   This will allow to control smplayer with a remote control.
   You can see a list of all available actions in "Preferences->Keyboard and
   mouse". Under the "Name" column in the shortcut editor you've got all 
   action's names.
   When using -action all other parameters (except ini-path) are ignored.
   So it you want to open a movie and enter in fullscreen, this is NOT valid:
   [i]smplayer movie.avi -action fullscreen[/i]
   But you can do it in two steps:
   [i]smplayer movie.avi[/i]
   [i]smplayer -action fullscreen[/i]
   The exit code will be 0 if the -action option is successful and -1 
   if there's an error.
 * In Windows, along with the screensaver, the monitor power off will be
   disabled too.
 * (By user request) Added a new option in Preferences->Interface: 
   "Remember position and size" (of the main window). Checked by default.
 * (By user request) Added two new optins in Preferences->General->Video & audio:
   "Direct rendering" and "Double buffering".
 * Changed the behavior of "Use postprocessing" and "Volume normalization"
   in Preferences->General. Previously if you check "Use postprocessing" for
   instance, then all videos will use postprocessing, no matter of the
   setting in Video->Filter->Postprocessing. Now this specifies the
   default setting for new videos. If checked, all new videos you open
   will have the option Video->Filter->Postprocessing enabled but you
   [b]can[/b] disable it if you want. Previously this wasn't possible.
   I think this behavior is more consistent.
 * Almost all options in menus can have a shortcut.
 * Now the maximum value for volume is 100 instead of 99.
 * Recent files menu: now if the list is empty the submenu won't appear. 
   You can also set the max. number of items in the list to 0 in 
   Preferences->Interface.
 * Compilation time has been reduced.

[b]Version 0.5.21[/b]
 * Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.
 * Moved the video and audio sections in Preferences->General to a new
   tab, and moved also the font section in Subtitles to another tab, to
   try to make the preferences dialog smaller.

[b]Version 0.5.20[/b]
 * Updated the German, Ukrainian, Portuguese and Romanian translations.
 * Now it will exit from compact mode before playing an audio file. Otherwise
   the GUI would not have any menus or buttons at all.
 * Temporary fix: in playlist, the latest_dir won't be changed when adding
   multiple files, to avoid that wrong paths with dvd:, vcd:... could be 
   used. 

[b]Version 0.5.19[/b]
 * Updated the German and Polish translations.
 * (Windows) The priority of the SMPlayer process is changed accordingly
   to the priority of MPlayer (SMPlayer will try to run with higher priority).
   Note: not much tested.
 * As a lot of people have complained, I changed "Brazilian Portuguese" and
   "Portuguese from Portugal" to "Portuguese - Brazil" and 
   "Portuguese - Portugal".

[b]Version 0.5.18[/b]
 * Updated the Russian translation.
 * Added support for audio CDs (only tested with one disc) so please 
   test yourself and report problems. Test also if VCD and DVD still work
   properly.
   Note: I don't know if this option will work on Windows, I never
   could play an audio CD with the Windows version of MPlayer.

[b]Version 0.5.17[/b]
 * Updated the Brazilian Portuguese, Slovak, Ukrainian, German and 
   Portuguese from Portugal translations.
 * Now QCoreApplication::arguments () will be used to read the arguments from
   command line if Qt > 4.1. On NT-based Windows this should allow the program 
   to get the right characters if the filename contains characters from other
   alphabets. 

[b]Version 0.5.16[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian and Polish translations.
 * Added two new translations: Romanian and Portuguese from Portugal.

[b]Version 0.5.15[/b]
 * Updated the Russian, Italian, Swedish, German, Ukrainian, Polish and
   Simplified-Chinese translations.
 * (By user request) Added an option in Preferences->General to enable the 
   postprocessing filter for all videos.

[b]Version 0.5.14[/b]
 * Updated the Swedish, Ukrainian and Polish translations.
 * I think for volume normalization it's best to have a global option, so
   I added a volume normalization option in Preferences->General. If checked
   the volnorm filter will be used for all files.
 * Added an option in Preferences->General to set the maximum amplification
   level for softvol. By default 110. Valid range 10-10000.

[b]Version 0.5.13[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German and Polish translations.
 * (By user request) Now the mouse wheel can be configured to zoom the video
   (Preferences->Keyboard and mouse->Mouse).
   Note: compatibility couldn't be kept, if you have previosly changed the 
   behavior of the mouse wheel you'll need to change it again.
 * Now the options in the menu Video->Size will always be executed even if the
   option is already selected. Useful if you resized the window. Also added
   shortcuts for Size->100% and Size->200% (Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+2) and I'm very
   sorry but these shortcuts can't be changed (and these shortcuts will only
   work if the menu is visible).
 * (By user request) Added the option Audio->Filters->Volume normalization.
   Note: this option only affects the current file, if you want the filter 
   to be used for all files add "volnorm" to the audio filters field in 
   Preferences->Advanced.
 * (By user request) Clicking in the system tray icon with the mouse middle
   button pauses/unpauses the file.
 * Now tooltips for QActions are explicitly created, to try to work around 
   a bug in Qt 4.3.

[b]Version 0.5.12[/b]
 * Updated the Swedish, German and Ukrainian translations (although changes
   I've just made could have broken them...)
 * Reorganized a little bit the preferences dialog, by using several tab
   widgets. This prevents that sections grow to much.
 * Better explained the "MPlayer language" section (I hope) and added
   regular expressions for Spanish, Italian, German and French in the 
   comboboxes, taken from the MPlayer translation files (completely
   untested!).

[b]Version 0.5.11[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian and German translations.
 * Shortcuts for previous and next items in playlist didn't work in main
   window. Fixed.
 * Added an option in Preferences->Subtitles to use the new -subfont option
   in MPlayer. In the future SMPlayer will try to autodetect when this option
   is needed.
 * Added in Preferences a new section: MPlayer language, where the user can
   change some of the texts that SMPlayer looks for. Intended in case that 
   MPlayer displays its messages in another language. (Unfortunately MPlayer
   can't change language at runtime).

[b]Version 0.5.10[/b]
 * Moved the denoise submenu inside the video filter menu.
 * (By user request) Added the option "AC3/DTS pass-through S/PDIF" in 
   Preferences->General. It will simply add "-afm hwac3" to the command line.
 * Renamed "Yadif (mode 0)" to "Yadif (normal)", and "Yadif (mode 1)" to
   "Yadif (double framerate)".

[b]Version 0.5.9[/b]
 * Updated the Swedish, German, Ukrainian and Polish translations.
 * The application was probably getting the wrong screen resolution if 
   a virtual desktop was enabled. I hope this is fixed now.

[b]Version 0.5.8[/b]
 * Updated the Italian, Simplified-Chinese and Swedish translations.
 * Added two new options in the Video->Deinterlace menu: kerndeint and
   yadif (mode 1). The latter option should give a much more fluid motion than
   the normal yadif option, but you need a really fast computer, as this
   option uses a lot of CPU.
   Some videos require to change the field dominance to work properly, so an 
   option for this will be added in the future. Meanwhile you can pass the
   option -field-dominance to mplayer if you need it.

[b]Version 0.5.7[/b]
 * Added *.ac3 to the list of audio filters in the open dialogs.
 * On startup, if the previous height of the window is less than 200, then
   the window is resized to the default size.
 * Updated the Polish and German translations.
 * Updated the instructions to make a deb package in Install.txt.

[b]Version 0.5.6[/b]
 * Updated the German and Ukrainian translations.
 * Changed the buttons in the floating control from QPushButtons to 
   QToolButtons.
 * Added an option in Preferences to enable or disable the cache.
   (Cache could be disabled by setting it to 0, but this is clearer).
   The cache is [b]disabled[/b] by default, as it seems this option 
   causes some trouble with some video formats. As a side effect now
   videos start to play faster.

[b]Version 0.5.5[/b]
 * Added in the audio menu an option to load an external audio file (and 
   another one to unload it). This allows to watch movies on which the
   audio track is in an external file (mp3, wav...).
   Note: if you play the movie again later, you'll see two audio tracks
   in the menus (the original one, and the external one), but changing
   tracks doesn't work. Strange things may happen if you do it.
 * Added the option "dont_use_eq_options" in the config file, ([preferences]
   section). If set to true, smplayer won't pass the options -brightness,
   -contrast, -hue, and -saturation to mplayer. It seems that some graphic
   cards don't support them or have some kind of problem with them.
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Added an empty icon for gamma (to prevent this slider to be higher than the
   rest).

[b]Version 0.5.4[/b]
 * The size of the floating control can be changed, editing the config file.
   Option floating_control_width under the [default_gui] section. The value
   is a percentage (100 = all screen width, 50 = half of the screen width).
   By default, 100.
 * The size and position of the main window will be remembered.
 * (Qt 4) The balloon that remembers you that the program is already running
   in the system tray will be shown only 5 times.

[b]Version 0.5.3[/b]
 * Updated the Polish and Russian translations.
 * New fullscreen control widget, smaller than the previous one. If using Qt 4
   it's better not to use the CleanLooks style, its buttons are huge and look
   awful in this widget.
 * Fixed bug #1729705 (I hope). This has required a lot of changes, so other
   bugs may appear.

[b]Version 0.5.2[/b]
 * Updated the German and Ukrainian translations.
 * (Qt 4) Option Open->Close, now it exits from fullscreen mode before closing 
   the window.
 * Now most options in the subtitle menu are disabled if there's none subtitle 
   selected.
 * If the option Play->Repeat is enabled, files will start to play from
   the beginning.
 * (By user request) Now it's possible to choose the path of the ini file.
   This is done by the -ini-path command line option. Example:
   smplayer -ini-path /tmp
   will try to read the configuration from /tmp/smplayer.ini.
   The path is optional, if none is passed then it will use the application
   path, so "smplayer -ini-path" will read the configuration from smplayer.ini
   in the application path.
   This feature requires Qt 4. The option -ini-path (and the optional argument)
   will be ignored if compiled with Qt 3. This option won't work either with
   KDE support (and in this case you'll get an error if you try to use the
   -ini-path option).
 * Assigned the keys F5 and F6 for show_main_toolbar and show_language_toolbar,
   and updated shortcuts/default.keys with the new keys.

[b]Version 0.5.1[/b]
 * Updated the Traditional Chinese and Bulgarian translations.
 * Now the title bar shows "file name - SMPlayer", instead of 
   "SMPlayer - file name".
 * MPlayer can be compiled to display its texts in another language, but 
   SMPlayer requires the texts to be in English. Unfortunately it's not 
   possible to change the MPlayer language without recompiling. This is a 
   problem. As a work-around I've made some of the internal regular expressions 
   configurable (by editing the config file).  
   rx_endoffile should specify the text that MPlayer outputs when a file has
   arrived to the end (by default "^Exiting... \\(End of file\\)"). If SMPlayer
   fails to catch this text, the playlist won't work properly.
   rx_novideo should specify the text that MPlayer outputs when a file has
   no video, by default "^Video: no video". If SMPlayer fails to catch this 
   text, the video window won't be hidden when playing sound files.
   There are other English texts which SMPlayer looks for, but they are far
   less important (most of them are just simply displayed on the status bar).
 * (By user request) Created an action to change the window from normal size 
   to double size and vice versa (this new action doesn't appear in any of the 
   menus, it's handled by a key shortcut, by default CTRL+D).
   The best way would be to add key shortcuts to all Video->Size suboptions,
   but it's not possible for the moment (I actually can add shortcuts but 
   they won't be configurable).
 * It seems that it's not a good idea to have the debian subdirectory in the
   sources, as it can conflict with the one made by package maintainers.
   As a quick solution, for now I've just renamed it to debian-rvm. If you want
   to create a deb package with dpkg-buildpackage, just rename it back to 
   debian.

[b]Version 0.5.0[/b]
 * Updated the Italian, German and Ukrainian translations.

[b]Version 0.4.30[/b]
 * Updated the Japanese and Serbian translations.
 * Added the Traditional Chinese translation.
 * debian/control: now depends on mplayer | mplayer-nogui
 * Install.txt: explained how to create a deb package.

[b]Version 0.4.29[/b]
 * Fixed bug #1725272 (the LCD in the floating control didn't show the hours).
 * Added the debian subdirectory (created in a kubuntu 7.04). This way it's
   possible to create a deb package.
 * Updated the German and Ukrainian translations.

[b]Version 0.4.28[/b]
 * Written the documents Install.txt and Release_notes.txt, and updated
   Readme.txt.
 * Updated the Polish translation.
 * Added the Serbian translation.

[b]Version 0.4.27[/b]
 * Applied patch to fix bug #1703280.
 * Now the tooltip in the system tray icon should display the same as the window
   title.

[b]Version 0.4.26[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German, Polish, Dutch, Chinese and Turkish 
   translations.

[b]Version 0.4.25[/b]
 * Not providing a default for SSA/ASS style override, as this setting may
   affect real SSA/ASS subtitles. Added a "whatsthis" help for this field.
 * Now DESTDIR is used in the Makefile to select the installation directory, 
   and changed the smplayer.spec to use it.
 * Updated the Ukrainian and German translations.

[b]Version 0.4.24[/b]
 * Updated the Italian and Polish translations.
 * Added support for SSA/ASS style override (-ass-force-style option in 
   mplayer). As there are a lot of options for styles, I just simply added a 
   line edit so you can enter the styles you want. This option may be very 
   useful with srt/sub files when using the SSA/ASS library, as subtitles may 
   look much nicer.
   By default, it will use "Bold=1,Outline=2,Shadow=2" which provides a 
   nice black shadow.
   Info about these styles can be found at:
   http://www.perlfu.co.uk/projects/asa/ass-specs.doc (look at chapter 5)

[b]Version 0.4.23[/b]
 * Updated the Turkish, German, Ukrainian, Swedish and Polish translations.
 * Moved all translations to a subdir: src/translations.
   And if TRANSLATION_PATH is not defined on compilation, smplayer will look
   for translations in application_path/translations/ (this is intended for 
   Windows).
 * Changed the default colorkey to 0x020202 (this really was the old colorkey).
 * Made the colorkey field in preferences editable, so there's two ways to
   set the colorkey: typing it yourself or selecting a color in the color
   dialog. Warning: currently no check is performed on the typed value. If
   the value is invalid it would return 0 (black).
   The value must be in hexadecimal, this way: #RRGGBB, where RR, GG
   and BB are the red, green and blue components of the color.

[b]Version 0.4.22[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * (Playlist) After removing the selected items, it tries to keep the cursor 
    on the same row it was before (previosly the cursor was always moved to 
    the 1st row).
 * Made the rest of actions translatable.
 * Added an option in the preferences dialog (subtitles tab) to select the
   default position of the subtitles. 100 means the bottom of the video window
   while 0 mean the top.
 * The colorkey is configurable now. Preferences->Advanced.

[b]Version 0.4.21[/b]
 * Updated the Turkish translation.
 * Parses the StreamTitle line from Shoutcast streams, and displays it in the
   info window and title bar.

[b]Version 0.4.20[/b]
 * Updated the Japanese, Czech, Polish, Italian and Chinese translations.
 * Floating control: don't assume that in fullscreen mode the screen starts 
   at 0x0 (it might be on a 2nd monitor). This may fix the problem on which the
   floating control may show on the wrong monitor. 
 * Playlist: the playlist is now only marked as "modified" only when changed
   by the user (and not when smplayer adds items to it, for instance, the
   files loaded from command line).
 * (By user request) New option in preferences (config file only): 
   initial_panscan_factor. It specifies the default zoom value all new videos 
   will have (by default 1.0).

[b]Version 0.4.19[/b]
 * Updated the German and Russian translations.
 * Changed the colorkey. The one in 0.4.18 didn't work on Windows with
   directx.
 * Added a system tray icon if compiled with Qt 3 and KDE support.

[b]Version 0.4.18[/b]
 * Updated the Swedish, German and Ukrainian translations.
 * Qt 4: now the time and volume sliders should work better. Previously
   it wasn't easy to drag the slider's handle if it was bigger than usual.
   Now the actual size of the handle is taken into account so dragging should
   work as expected.

[b]Version 0.4.17[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German, Russian, Polish and Bulgarian translations.
 * Added the Swedish translation.
 * Now you can open several files through command line: 
   smplayer video1.avi video2.avi music.mp3
   or
   smplayer *.mp3
   The first file will be opened by a function which is able to handle *.m3u
   files and directories. The rest will simply be added to the playlist.
   As this feature has required important changes, it might have introduced bugs.
   Report if you notice something strange.
 * Fixed a bug in the playlist. The first item played wasn't marked sometimes 
   as played.

[b]Version 0.4.16[/b]
 * Updated the Chinese and Russian translations.
 * Added support for the sub_step command (in the Subtitles menu). This allow 
   you to move to the previous or next subtitle line in the subtitle files. 
   It can help you to synchronize the subtitles.
   Note: this setting is not saved, reasons: 1) if you need to use these 
   options maybe it's because the subtitle file has a serious sinchronization 
   problem and you'll probably have to adjust the subtitles several times, 
   2) it's not easy to do it.
 * At last the "+10 seconds", "+1 minute"... options in the menus show the
   actual time to jump (if you modified the default values in preferences).

[b]Version 0.4.15[/b]
 * Updated the Italian translation.
 * Server commands: the playlist functions now work with Qt 4.
 * The function of the mouse buttons are configurable again. With this smplayer
   retrieves all functionality from 0.4.7.

[b]Version 0.4.14[/b]
 * Updated the Polish, Ukrainian and German translations.
 * The function command in server should work again. If you don't know
   what I'm talking about, do "telnet localhost 8000" (or the port configured 
   in preferences) and type "list functions". This feature allows to control
   smplayer remotely. Note: I've just realized that the playlist functions
   currently don't work if using Qt 4.

[b]Version 0.4.13[/b]
 * Updated the German, Russian and Chinese translations.
 * Added the Turkish translation.
 * Actions editor: checking for conflicts, now it will only beep due to
   conflicts after editing a shortcut. This prevents beeps when entering
   in the preferences dialog, which can be confuse for the user.
 * Actions editor: now it will display error message if the key shortcut
   file can't be saved or loaded.
 * Actions editor: Shortcuts are shown left aligned.
 * I spent some time writing a widget which would allow to enter a shortcut
   just pressing the key (or combination of keys), instead of typing it.
   I took some code from qt-3 designer, and yes, it works pretty well.
   But at the end I'm not using it... it doesn't work well with qt 4 (some
   keys can't be entered, like Tab or the cursors). And moreover with qt 3
   it isn't really possible to enter all keys. For instance with a Spanish 
   keyboard it seems impossible to enter the key ">".
   But in case you want to try it yourself, edit the file actionseditor.cpp and
   change the line 
   #define USE_KEYCHOOSER 0
   to
   #define USE_KEYCHOOSER 1

[b]Version 0.4.12[/b]
 * The actions editor is now in the preferences dialog.
 * Now smplayer will look for icons in a directory named "themes" instead
   of "icons" (defined with THEMES_PATH in Makefile). This is because in the 
   future there might be more things besides icons. 
 * smplayer will look for key shortcuts files in a directory named "shortcuts"
   (SHORTCUTS_PATH in Makefile).
 * Updated the German, Russian and Ukrainian translations.

[b]Version 0.4.11[/b]
 * Fixed a bug in actions editor: default shortcuts were lost on first run.
   If you used 0.4.10 edit the config file and delete the [actions] section.
 * More improvements in actions editor. Now it's possible to save the actions
   to a external file, and load it. It also checks for conflicts (the same
   shortcut assigned to other actions).
 * Removed the src/icons directory. Icons will be in another package 
   (and current Makefile is broken, don't try "make install").

[b]Version 0.4.10[/b]
 * Actions editor: now the actions are saved and loaded to the config file.

[b]Version 0.4.9[/b]
 * Fixed a segfault when selected Open->Quit (Qt 4).
 * Using UTF-8 for all QTextStreams in server.cpp and client.cpp.
 * Updated the Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese, Polish, Dutch and Italian 
   translations.
 * More improvements on the actions editor. Better code for Qt 4, and 
   now it shows the icon and name of the action, along with the description.
   The actions editor is far to be finished so it's hidden. If you want to see 
   it, press G. You can change the shortcuts by double clicking in the 
   shortcuts cell. The new shortcuts you define will work for the current
   session, but they won't be saved.

[b]Version 0.4.8[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Using now QActions for all key shortcuts.
 * Started to write the actions editor.

[b]Version 0.4.7[/b]
 * Updated the Polish, German, Ukrainian and Italian translations.
 * As the panscan feature seems to work well, even in Windows, I added 
   a new submenu "Panscan" in the Video menu. The videos should also remember 
   the zoom value.

[b]Version 0.4.6[/b]
 * Experimental pan&scan feature. It's possible to move the video window
   (left, right, up and down) and also zoom it. You increase zoom with key
   "E" and decrease with "W". You can move the window with ALT + cursor keys.
   This is experimental, just to test if this can be done. The settings
   are not saved anywhere, in fact resizing the window resets all values
   to the defaults. 
   Note: the zoom affects the OSD too, including subtitles.

[b]Version 0.4.5[/b]
 * The fix in 0.4.4 actually brokes smplayer on Windows. The video disappears
   when the video is resized. So now this is an option that can be enabled
   or disabled (Preferences->Advanced, Don't repaint the background of the 
   video window). This option is Off by default, as it works well in linux 
   with Qt 3 and on Windows with Qt 4. If you use Qt 4 on linux and have the 
   problem mentioned in the 0.4.4 changelog, you may check this option and see
   if it helps.

[b]Version 0.4.4[/b]
 * Updated the Slovak, German, Ukrainian and Polish translations.
 * A very important fix (at least for me). Now when the main window is
   resized the video should not flicker at all (I made this specially for
   Qt 4, where the flicker was very annoying, but at the end the result is
   much better with Qt 3). The most important is that this fixes a repaint
   problem with Qt 4. Sometimes the video window got black (totally or 
   partially) when closing another window (or menu) that was over it (I could
   reproduce it by entering in the preferences dialog, and changing the 
   language).
   I don't know if someone else had this problem (I didn't get any report
   about it), but it happened to me and it was really annoying. Now this
   is FIXED!!!

[b]Version 0.4.3[/b]
 * On startup the toolbars always appeared even if they were hidden in the
   previous session. Fixed (I hope).
 * Changes in playlist: now if the playlist has been changed, it will ask you
   to save it before loading a another playlist. It will also ask you if
   you try to open a dvd or vcd, because that clears the playlist.
   It won't ask you when you close the application, because the current
   playlist is saved to the config file and so it will retrieved on startup.
 * Merged the info window and advanced file settings in one thing: 
   "View info & properties".
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.4.2[/b]
 * If in compact mode, on startup the toolbars were visible. Fixed.
 * Some improvements on the playlist docked in the main window, but there
   are still some issues. I'm afraid this can't be completely fixed until the 
   application is ported to Qt 4.

[b]Version 0.4.1[/b]
 * Updated the Chinese, Russian, Italian, German, Ukrainian and Polish
   translations.
 * Some options in menus didn't update the name after a language change. Fixed.
 * Some improvements in the tray icon: 
    - If the main window is hidden, it will became visible just before playing 
      a video. Now this works too with the (playlist) next and previous options. 
    - The tray icon shows a tooltip with the name of the current file.
    - Added two options to the context menu: playlist and preferences.
 * The playlist saves to the config file the current playlist just before
   quiting and loads again on startup.
 * Renamed the Exit option to Close. If the system tray icon is not activated
   then the Close option finishes the application. But if the system tray icon 
   is activated then it just hides it. The Quit option always finishes the 
   application, no matter if the tray icon is activated or not (the Quit 
   option doesn't show if Qt < 4.2).

[b]Version 0.4.0[/b]
 Initially version 0.4.0 was to be released once the key shortcuts were
 configurable. But as it seems it still takes some time for that, and 
 considering that I've implemented some things actually planned for future
 versions (VCD, system tray icon) I change to 0.4.0 now (even though I've just
 implemented the system tray icon and it may have bugs).
 Main objective for 0.5.0 is still configurable shortcuts, and I expect it to
 be soon, very soon.

 * More improvements in tray icon. Just test it. Remember that you need to
   compile at least with Qt 4.2. I think this feature is now quite usable.
   There's a known problem, though, the next and previous options in the
   context menu don't force a show() in the main window. This is ok for music.
   But if it's a video then the main window won't appear until you make
   visible yourself.
 * The main window only shows once on startup, that prevents that the main 
   window can be seen for a little moment without toolbars.
 * The width of the floating control can be configured (for now just by 
   editing the configuration file, look for floating_control_width, the value is
   the desired width in %, by default 75%).
 * Now if you select Open->VCD and the cdrom device is not configured, a
   warning will show and then the preferences dialog will open so you can
   configure it.
 * Disabled style switching again, because it crashes with Qt 4 (I find
   Qt 4 more unstable than Qt 3...)
 * Updated the Ukrainian and Bulgarian translations.

[b]Version 0.3.45[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German and Russian translations.
 * Some improvements in the tray icon. Now it has a new context menu,
   and it saves its state (mainly if the main window is visible or not) 
   to recover it on startup. Unfortunately it doesn't work well if the
   single instance option is activated.
   And if you click on the close button the application will hide but it
   will still running in the tray.

[b]Version 0.3.44[/b]
 * Added the Bulgarian translation.
 * Updated the Polish translation.
 * Qt 4: Made the repaint of the mplayer window more or less like Qt 3.
   At least this seems to fix some small cuts in the audio when resizing.
   But still the window is getting black after changing the language in
   preferences. I don't know why.
   Report if you find problems with this (more flickering than before or 
   something).
 * Started to implement the system tray icon. You need Qt 4.2 to see it.

[b]Version 0.3.43[/b]
 * Updated the Dutch translation.
 * When DOCK_PLAYLIST is set 1, the playlist was always shown when exiting from
   fullscreen, even if it was hidden previously. Fixed.
 * Qt 4: now the time (and volume) slider go to the point you click on the bar.
 * Windows: the playlist was always above the main window. This should be
   fixed now. The VCD option in the Open menu is disabled, as mplayer in
   Windows doesn't support VCDs yet. Anyway you can watch VCDs by opening the
   *.dat files you'll see in the drive.
 * STYLE_SWITCHING option in config.h activated by default now. This will
   allow you to switch the Qt style at runtime (Preferences->Interface).
   This option wasn't enabled by default because it seems it had some issues
   (some colors might not be correct). Anyway I let you to test it.

[b]Version 0.3.42[/b]
 * VCD support has triggered a problem. If title #1 of a VCD (or DVD) can't
   be played, the GUI doesn't get the info of the rest of titles (which
   probably could be played). Now the application detects that case and
   passes that info.
 * Now when a VCD or DVD start to play, all titles are added to the playlist
   (clearing all previous contents), so when a title finishes the next one 
   will be played.
 * I think those 2 previous things can improve DVD support. Because it seems
   that a lot of people got confused when the first title of a DVD didn't
   play, even thinking that smplayer can't play DVDs at all. Now if the
   first title fails the 2nd will be played. Anyway I couldn't test this,
   because I don't have any DVD which first title doesn't play.
 * Added the option vcd_initial_title for preferences (this is a config
   option, it's not in the preferences dialog yet). It specifies the
   title number which should be played when you select Open->VCD. By 
   default 2.
 * And added support for VCDs in other parts of the code. For instance
   the info window recognizes VCDs and displays a different icon for them.
   Or you can play a VCD through command line: [i]smplayer vcd://3[/i] (will 
   play title #3), or just simply [i]smplayer vcd:[/i] (which is the same
   as selecting Open->VCD).
 * Now the option Video->Aspect ratio->Autodetect will use the aspect
   ratio of the mplayer window, instead of the file aspect rato. That makes
   that some filters could work better. (Anyway I don't know if this could have
   any secondary effect...)
 * Renamed the icon them Test as Oxygen.

[b]Version 0.3.41[/b]
 * Updated the Hungarian translation.
 * Started the VCD stuff. Now you can play VCD's. But... to implement this
   feature I used a VCD created by k3b with 2 videoclips. mplayer reports
   that there are 3 titles in the disc. The first one can't be played
   (maybe it has control info or something), but that makes that smplayer
   doesn't get the info about available titles. To "fix" it smplayer will
   start to play all VCDs from title 2 (instead of 1) but of course I'm not
   sure if it is safe to assume that all discs (in mplayer) start at title 2.
   So if you have a lot of VCDs, please test. 
   BTW, I think mplayer on Windows doesn't support VCDs...

[b]Version 0.3.40[/b]
 * Added a new icon theme "Silk" created by ilGaspa 
   (http://www.phpbbplanet.com/smplayer/viewtopic.php?t=116)
 * Added another icon theme "MacLike", by Charles Barcza.
 * Updated the Ukrainian and German translations.
 * Qt 4: The video equalizer lost its icons everytime an icon theme change was
   made. Fixed.
 * It seems that drag&drop didn't work with filenames with non-latin1 
   characters if the drag was made from Konqueror. It seems the problem that
   kde encodes the filenames using the current locale but Qt expects
   to be in UTF-8. Now drag&drop from Konqueror should work but it's required
   to compile smplayer with kde support.
   Of course, if your system's encoding is UTF-8 then there's not problem at all.
 * Tried to avoid the use of double slashes (/usr//share...) in paths. 

[b]Version 0.3.39[/b]
 * Updated the Czech, Polish, French, German and Spanish translations.
 * KDE support fixes: now the embedded icons should show again. Now you
   can pass a filename to open from command line.
 * Changes in Makefile. if "make KDE_SUPPORT=1" doesn't work for you,
   edit the Makefile and change the kde paths. 
   You also can pass the paths through command line, example:
   make KDE_SUPPORT=1 KDE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/kde

[b]Version 0.3.38[/b]
 * Moved most of the single instance stuff to another class (CSManager). That
   simplifies the BaseGui code.
 * Fixed an old bug. If the server which smplayer tries to connect to 
   on startup doesn't respond anything, smplayer will wait and wait... 
   forever. Now it waits 4 seconds, after that smplayer starts and reports 
   to the user about the problem, and disables the single instance option.
 * KDE dialogs: now the Qt filters are converted to the KDE format. Now
   the KDE dialogs should work.
 * Now you can compile smplayer with KDE support just by typing:
   make KDE_SUPPORT=1
 * Updated the Japanese, Russian and Czech translations.

[b]Version 0.3.37[/b]
 * Set the focus to video window after the user has selected an audio or
   subtitle from the toolbar.
 * Now the video should keep paused the when switching to fullscreen mode.
 * Finally I could compile smplayer with kde support. Now smplayer can
   show the kde open dialogs. But it seems that the filter parameter is not
   fully compatible with the Qt dialogs, so some of the dialogs could be
   useless. I'll try to fix it anyway. There are also other problems:
   the embedded icons don't show, you'll have to use any other icon set.
   And for some reason the application path is changed to /usr/bin so
   smplayer could have problems finding its files.
   If you want to test it, edit the smplayer.pro and look for "KDE_SUPPORT"
   and uncomment the 3 lines (and change the kde paths...). I'll try to
   make it easier in future releases. Ah, don't forget to compile with Qt 3.
 * Updated the Polish translation.

[b]Version 0.3.36[/b]
 * Improved a little bit the new subtitles' code. If you're watching a
   video with subtitles and you load a new subtitle file, smplayer will
   try to keep using the same subtitle if it is still present (you may
   think that it would better to select the subtitle from the file that
   user has loaded, but it's impossible to know which one it is).
   The same would happen if you unload the subtitle file, smplayer will 
   try to keep the previous selected subtitle, if it's one of the available
   subtitles. If it's not, the none subtitle will be selected.
   On the other hand, if you load a subtitle file to a video which didn't
   have any subtitle, then smplayer may select one subtitle, according to
   the preferences settings (if subtitle autoload is activated, it will
   select the first one or the user's preferred language if found).
 * Now you can drag directories to the playlist. It will add all files
   in it (it's not recursive, it won't add files in subdirectories).
 * Now you can open DVD iso files. Just simply select the *.iso file
   in the Open->File dialog. You can also drag it to the main window or
   playlist. The file must have the extension iso to be identified. If the
   image has another extension there's another way to open it, select
   Open->DVD from folder. This dialog will only allow you to choose a
   directory but you can type after it the filename.
 * Updated the German and Georgian translations.

[b]Version 0.3.35[/b]
 * Almost all subtitle code has been rewritten. I think that now it's much
   better. For instance, now you can load a idx/sub file and you'll be able 
   to select among all languages that the file provides. You can have a 
   mkv file with embedded subtitles, load an idx/sub file (or srt, sub...) 
   and all subtitles will be available.
   There's also a new option in the subtitles menu to unload the previous
   subtitle file you might have loaded.
   This new code is still under testing, and it could have bugs. If you
   see something strange, please report.
 * Updated the Ukrainian, Czech, Georgian, Polish, Russian and Chinese 
   translations.

[b]Version 0.3.34[/b]
 * Updated the Dutch, Ukrainian, German, Polish and Italian translations.
 * Added the Czech translation by Martin Dvořák.
 * Some cosmetic changes: new about dialog, and now the language combo
   in preferences displays the language name, along with the ISO code.

[b]Version 0.3.33[/b]
 * Changes in playlist: converted the buttons and menus to QAction's. This
   has required to make the playlist a QMainWindow (it was a QWidget before).
 * And added again the previous and next buttons to main window.
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.3.32[/b]
 * Updated the Russian and Polish translations.
 * Added options to hide the toolbars (in the Options menu).

[b]Version 0.3.31[/b]
 * Created a new floating control widget. This time it's not a toolbar so
   I hope that this finally fixes the problems with the floating control.

[b]Version 0.3.30[/b]
 * Updated the Polish, Hungarian and Chinese translations.
 * Some people report that the control widget doesn't appear where it 
   should but a little bit above the bottom. I tried to fix it by reparenting
   the widget and changing the flags. It seems to work well with Qt 3, but
   with Qt 4 it does really strange things: the widget is huge. Resize doesn't
   work or crashed the program. So finally the code is disabled (even for
   Qt 3). If you wanna to test it: edit the config.h and set 
   REPARENT_CONTROLWIDGET to 1 (and recompile).

[b]Version 0.3.29[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Fixed a crash when using Qt 4 with the new control widget.
 * Now the control widget displays over the video, not moving it.
 * You can now drag a subtitle file to the main window.
 * Tried to use the kde open dialog, unsuccessfully.

[b]Version 0.3.28[/b]
 * Updated the German, Polish and Ukrainian translations.
 * Updated the French translation by David <goondy@free.fr>
 * Now the control widget is only one toolbar, but if it gets too small
   it will replaced by another widget with less buttons. 

[b]Version 0.3.21 - 0.3.27[/b]
 * A lot of internal changes: now QAction's are used for most of the menus,
   constants have been changed to enums. Due to the amount of changes it's
   possible that something could have broken. Please test it, specially 
   audio and subtitle selection, aspect ratio options, and well... everything
   in the menus...
 * The Gui class has been divided into BaseGui and DefaultGui. The intention
   of this it to allow to create alternative GUI's easily (when I say GUI in 
   fact I mean the main window). The DefaultGui is less than 300 lines of code.
 * The new GUI has been written from scratch and it has some toolbars. This
   GUI has been written today in a few hours and it's not finished yet.
   Unfortunately the "controlwidget over the video" from previous releases
   has not been implemented yet in this GUI.
 * Updated the Italian, German, Hungarian and Russian translations.
 * Added the Georgian translation.

[b]Version 0.3.20[/b]
 * Added new icon themes by Charles Barcza.
 * Updated the German and Polish translations.
 * The controlwidget over the video now it seems that works too with Qt 3,
   so now it's activated by default. Please test it.
 * The priority options in preferences are hidden too in Qt 4 (priority is
   for Windows only).
 * Removed the old fullscreen code.

[b]Version 0.3.19[/b]
 * Updated the Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian, German and Polish translations.
 * It seems that some videos don't start at sec. 0 so now smplayer will
   try to get the starting time and subtract that time from the current time.
   That's need for the -ss option to work properly with those videos.
 * Set some "buddies" in filepreferencesdialog so it can be used with the
   keyboard.
 * Some internal changes and small fixes.
 * New compilation option in config.h: CONTROLWIDGET_OVER_VIDEO
   If set to 1, the controlwidget will be shown in fullscreen
   *over* the video (not moving the video) when the user move the mouse
   to the bottom area of the screen.
   Now if someone knows how to get rid of the KDE taskbar that appears at
   the same time...

[b]Version 0.3.18[/b]
 * Icon sets: The logo didn't change in the title bar of some windows. Fixed.
 * (Qt 3 only) Time slider: now the slider goes to the point the user has 
   clicked on. The volume slider has the same behavior.  
 * Now it's possible to choose a preferred language for subtitles. 
   (Only tested with two mkv files).
 * Added more "whatsthis" help in Preferences (Performance tab). Texts copied 
   from mplayer manpage.
 * Now the info window shows some icons, according to the media type 
   (video, audio, dvd, url). I'm afraid these icons are not customizable.

[b]Version 0.3.17[/b]
 * Updated the Polish, German and Ukrainian translations.
 * Added support for Qt 4 stylesheets. Now the icons sets, along with the
   *.png files, can contain a file named "style.qss". If that file exists
   smplayer will load it (the Test/ subdirectory includes one, based on a Qt 
   example). This allows to change color, size, style... of all Qt widgets
   (see screenshots). This feature requires Qt 4.2.
   The qss file is quite similar to a HTML css file. Detailed info:
   http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/stylesheet.html

[b]Version 0.3.16[/b]
 * Updated the Hungarian, German and Italian translations.
 * Added the Brazilian portuguese translation.
 * Added new icon theme blackPanther-Light by Charles Barcza.
 * Added a new option: Video->Size. This is a global option. If you set it
   for instance to 150%, all videos will be played at 150% of their original 
   size. 
   (This option won't work if checked "Advanced->Run mplayer in its 
   own window").

[b]Version 0.3.15b[/b]
 * Updated the Hungarian translation.
 * Added icon theme blackPanther-VistaLike by Charles Barcza.

[b]Version 0.3.15[/b]
 * Updated the German, Ukrainian and Polish translations.
 * Fixed a bug. Now you can pass a folder through command line. If it doesn't
   contain the video_ts folder, the contents of the directory will be added
   to the playlist.
 * Options->View info now shows more info about audio tracks and subtitles.
 * Created a new icon set: "Play" which changes some icons and adds some
   more. Just an example that shows that's possible to add new icons not
   present in the default set.

[b]Version 0.3.14[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Chinese, Italian and Japanese 
   translations.
 * Fixed a problem with the new icon set feature in Windows (the icon path 
   wasn't right).
 * Fixed some bugs with the "initial volume" widgets in preferences.
 * Process communication: the 2nd instance will send to the 1st instance
   the filename to be open encoded in UTF-8.
 * New option in preferences (General) to select a preferred audio language
   for videos with multiple audio tracks. See the "whatsthis" help to know
   more about this new option.

[b]Version 0.3.13[/b]
 * Updated the Ukrainian, German and Russian translations.
 * Made the apply preferences a little bit smarter. Now the mplayer process
   will be restarted only if needed. For example, changing the video output
   or the cache settings require mplayer to be restarted, but changing the
   language or the mouse button function does not.
   There are a lot of options in the preferences dialog and I'm not tested 
   all of them. Report if some setting is ignored or something.
 * Now you can change the language of the application at runtime. This has
   required a lot of changes. Report if some string has been left untranslated.
 * Configurable icons. Now smplayer can load icon sets. In 
   Preferences->Interface you'll find an option to select an iconset.
   Currently there are two: Default (the default embeded iconset) and Test
   (for testing, I've used the oxygen icons gathered by adrian5632)

[b]Version 0.3.12[/b]
 * Added the Ukrainian translation.
 * Updated the German and Polish translations.
 * Added the option Video->Stay on top. This is a global option.
 * Added Preferences->Interface->Language.
 * Moved the logs stuff from Advanced to a new tab.

[b]Version 0.3.11[/b]
 * Updated the Hungarian and Russian translations.
 * Sometimes when a video is played, smplayer doesn't get any info about it
   (you can notice because the aspect ratio may be wrong, length is 0, 
   resolution is 0x0, no info about subtitles...). I think this happens
   when a video is restarting but you open a new one before restarting 
   is finished (usually happens with internet streams, where a video can
   take some time to start to play). I think that now this problem is
   fixed, although I'm not completely sure as this bug is quite difficult to
   reproduce.
 * Now you can force the usage of a different language (translation).
   smplayer currently tries to use the translation file according to your
   locale. Now you can change the language by editing the configuration file
   and change the value of the option "language" (under the [Preferences] 
   section). Example: [i]language=es[/i] will display the messages in Spanish, 
   [i]language=fr[/i] will display them in French, [i]language=zh_CN[/i] will 
   display them in Chinese and so on.

[b]Version 0.3.10[/b]
 * Updated the German, Polish, Dutch, Italian, Russian and Chinese translations.
 * Bug fixed: if "fast seek to chapters in dvds" was checked, the -cache
   option wasn't used for internet streams.
 * Some options for logs added (Preferences->Advanced). Now you can disable 
   the mplayer or smplayer logs. There's also an option to filter the 
   smplayer output. Added too "what's this" help for these new options.

[b]Version 0.3.9[/b]
 * Updated the German, Hungarian, Russian and Spanish translations.
 * Internal change: made pref (Preferences) a global object (I hope not, 
   but this change could have broken something...) This is needed
   for the following:
 * A long awaited feature: you can save defaults for the video equalizer.
   Two buttons have been added to the video equalizer: "reset", will reset
   all controls to 0. "Set as default value" will store the current values
   and they will be used for new videos.
 * Fixed bug #1694644.

[b]Version 0.3.8[/b]
 * Added the Japanese and Dutch translations.
 * Updated the German, Italian, Polish and Slovak translations.
 * Added the option EXTERNAL_SLEEP in config.h (this is a compilation option,
   if you change it, you'll have to recompile). If set to 1, smplayer
   will use the function usleep from unistd.h instead of QThread::msleep()
   It can be useful if your Qt doesn't have QThread support.
 * I started to add some (what's this) help in the preferences dialog. 
   Drag the question mark in the title bar to a field and a text
   will appear explaining what's that option for. Currently only works
   in the General tab.

[b]Version 0.3.7[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Made changes to try to fix a compilation error in Windows (qmake bug)
 * Added a "Clear" option in the recent files menu, to clear the list.
 * Added an option in Play menu, to repeat (loop) the current file. This
   is a global option. If activated, when the video ends, it will start to 
   play again.
   As an unintended feature, if the video didn't start from the beginning, when
   repetition starts it won't start from the beginning but from the point
   it previously started. An example will explain it better: you have a 2 
   minute video, you play it with the repeat option off. When it gets to 
   1 minute you stop it and set the repeat option on. The video will resume 
   play from minute 1. When the video gets to minute 2 (end of video) it 
   will start to play again from minute 1.
   As I said, this is unintended, but I leave this way because maybe someone
   could find it useful.

[b]Version 0.3.6[/b]
 * Updated Polish, Italian, Chinese and Russian translations.
 * All icons are now png files.
 * Using the option -nofs for the mplayer command line.

[b]Version 0.3.5[/b]
 * Fixed a serious bug if using Qt 3. The key shortcuts were saved to a
   different file and not loaded.
 * Started to move from xpm icons to png. Right now a mix of both types
   is used. All icons in the preferences dialog are now png. Some of
   the icons in playlist are png too. But most of the icons in the main
   window are still xpm. As a test I changed the smplayer logo (which in
   fact is a Vista-Inspirate icon) with a new one designed by 
   Charles Barcza.

[b]Version 0.3.4[/b]
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Now you can choose the function of the mouse wheel: media seeking or
   volume control.

[b]Version 0.3.3[/b]
 * Updated the Italian, German, Polish and Chinese translations.
 * 10s, 1m and 10m seek can be configured: Preferences->GUI. 
   Note: the previous fixed values (10s, 1m, 10m) still appear in the menus 
   and tooltips. I'll fix it soon.
 * Mouse left click and double click functions can be configured
   in Preferences->GUI. 
   Note: the left click function is executed too when double clicking. I'll
   try to fix it, for now I recommend to use one of the two mouse functions,
   not both.
 * The initial volume can be configured in Preferences->GUI.

[b]Version 0.3.2[/b]
 * Added the Polish translation.
 * Removed obsolete texts from all translations.
 * Added in preferences an option to select the maximum number of
   items that the "recent files" menu should have. And added too a
   button to clear the list.
 * Renamed the Misc section in preferences to GUI. And moved non GUI items that
   were in this section to others.
 * Added some icons in the preferences dialog.
 * Changed some icons.

[b]Version 0.3.1[/b]
 * Updated the German, Italian, Russian and Hungarian translations.
 * Added some contributed files to the contrib subdirectory.
 * Added the uninstall section in the Makefile.
 * Added a smplayer_en_US.ts. Currently it's empty. Can be used to
   correct the english text, and also can be used to start a translation
   to other language.

[b]Version 0.3.0[/b]
 This release has only one small fix, but I change the version number to
 0.3.0. I think it's time.
 * The code in mplayerprocess for Windows wasn't used. Now it should be fixed.
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Updated the instructions to compile smplayer in README.txt.

[b]Version 0.2.44[/b]
 * Added the Hungarian translation.
 * Some changes in mplayerprocess.cpp, to make it a little faster.
 * A new interesting feature has been added: remember, smplayer install
   a server to listen a port (8000 by default) initially to communicate to 
   other instances. But now that server will understand some more commands.
   You can connect with it with "telnet localhost 8000" and type "help".
   For now you can pass any of the key functions. For instance the
   command "function pause", will pause the movie that smplayer is playing.
   "function fullscreen" will toggle fullscreen mode. You can get a list
   of all available functions with "list functions".
   This feature will allow other people to write small programs or scripts
   to control smplayer remotely (from another computer) or from a remote control.

[b]Version 0.2.43[/b]
 * Not converting to local 8 bit encoding. It seems that Qt already does, so
   doing twice only cause trouble.
 * Using QString::fromLocal8Bit() instead of 
   QTextCodec::codecForLocale()->toUnicode(). I think it's the same... 
 * Updated the Russian translation.
 * If unchecked the option for remembering media settings, now the settings
   are not really saved to config file (previously they were saved but not
   loaded).
 * Activated by default for Windows, an alternative code in mplayerprocess
   which seems to be faster, and can fix some slow down problems.

[b]Version 0.2.42[/b]
 * Updated the Chinese and Russian translations.
 * Convert filename, subtitle filename, and dvd device name to local 8 bit
   encoding before pass them to mplayer. I don't know if this will fix
   something or break something.
 * Some changes in mplayerprocess, trying to fix a problem in Windows, but
   unfortunately it's not fixed yet.

[b]Version 0.2.41[/b]
 * Mouse left click and double click will work now only in the video window.
 * Modified the Makefile to make possible to compile with Qt 4 from the
   source root. ("make prep" will adapt the code for Qt 4 and "make"
   will compile it). You may need to change the QMAKE variable.
 * Write some experimental code intented to fix a problem in Windows.
   Not compiled by default.

[b]Version 0.2.40[/b]
 * Updated the Slovak and German translations.
 * On Windows smplayer saves position and size of the main window to
   be restored after exiting from fullscreen mode.
 * Mouse left click and double click, configurable. For now only by editing
   the configuration file (look for left_click_function and 
   double_click_function). Valid values are any of the key functions (the
   list of key functions appears at the beginning of the smplayer log).
   Example: left_click_function=PAUSE
   Currently there's a problem: double click executes also the left click 
   function.
 * Changed the DVD and CD icons in preferences.

[b]Version 0.2.39[/b]
 * Added the Russian translation.
 * Now the dvd and cdrom devices have no default. If the user tries to
   play a dvd before configure it, a message box will show requesting
   him to configure it. After that the preferences dialog will be
   shown, with the drive's tab selected.
 * By the way, I've added some icons to the drive's configuration.

[b]Version 0.2.38[/b]
 * Added the Simplified-Chinese translation.
 * Removed some extra trailing spaces in some phrases.
 * Added copyright text to the new files.

[b]Version 0.2.37[/b]
 * Updated Italian & German translations.
 * Added setActiveWindow() too besides raise();
 * Raised the time that smplayer waits to mplayer process to finished. 
   Sometimes it's needed to call mplayer to get some info (available
   output drivers, codecs and so on). There's a problem about terminating
   that process: if we just wait until the process is finished there's
   the possibility that smplayer freezes if the mplayer process does.
   For that reason smplayer waits, but only some time. After that smplayer
   kills the mplayer process. That time was about 1 second, but sometimes
   (specially for the first run) mplayer takes more time. Now smplayer
   will wait as much 10 seconds.

[b]Version 0.2.36[/b]
 * Improved the single instance stuff. Now it seems it works with Qt 4, too.
   Added a few commands to the server. So now you can talk to it using 
   telnet.
 * Added some options in the preferences dialog. You can activate or disable
   the single instance feature, and set the port that the server will use.
   IMPORTANT: the single instance is disabled by default!
   Changes in any of these options require smplayer to be restarted.
 * Added the French translation. It's not complete yet.

[b]Version 0.2.35[/b]
 * Started to write the single instance stuff. Now when smplayer starts
   it sets a server to listen to a port (by default 8000). When a new
   instance is run it tries to connect to that port. If it has success it
   tries to verify that it's really smplayer behind that port. After that it
   sends to the first instance the file that the user wants to open (if any)
   and closes. The first instance opens the video.
   You can change the default port in the configuration file (look for 
   connection_port). Sorry I didn't have time to add an option in the 
   preferences dialog.
   This works in Qt 3 but fails in Qt 4. I don't know why, by an unknown
   reason the server in the first instance doesn't receive the open 
   command that the client in the 2nd instance sends. 
   It's too late, I'lltry to fix it tomorrow. By the way, this is the first 
   time I write code relative to sockets, ports, servers, clients... so someone
   more experienced is welcome to take a look to the code and to try to fix it.

[b]Version 0.2.34[/b]
 * Internal changes: moved Images and Keys to global.
 * Key shortcuts are loaded from config file. That means the now it's possible
   to change key shortcuts.
 * Preferences are saved when user press Ok or Apply in the preferences dialog.
 * Moved the "Include subtitles on screenshots" from General to Subtitles tab.
 * Fixed a bug with -cache and fast dvd chapter switch. The cache was disabled
   even if not playing a dvd.

[b]Version 0.2.33[/b]
 * Made settings a global object. A lot of internal changes, something
   could have broken.

[b]Version 0.2.32[/b]
 * Fixed a little bug in playlist. 
 * No flickering at all in the video when opening menus in Windows.
 * Rewritten keys.h, keys.cpp. Key shortcuts are saved.

[b]Version 0.2.31[/b]
 * Added the Italian translation made by Giancarlo Scola.
 * Now drag&drop urls works with Firefox, if compiled with Qt 3. 
   It already worked with Qt 4!
   As a secondary effect now plain text can be dropped into smplayer (Qt 3 only).
 * New option: Options->Show frame counter. If checked the current frame
   will be displayed in the status bar. Don't work properly with some formats.

[b]Version 0.2.30[/b]
 * Ok, I've just found out how to disable double buffering in a widget.
   So the blinking problem with Qt is definitely fixed now (I hope).

[b]Version 0.2.29[/b]
 * In linux, using Qt 4, the video window has an annoying blink every time a
   menu is open. As a quick fix I'm disabling double buffering. That fixes
   that problem, but now some widgets may be displayed not completely drawn.
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.2.28[/b]
 * Now you can drag&drop urls from a web browser. You can test it dragging
   the urls on this page: http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/streams.html
 * Added the option "include subtitles on screenshots" in Preferences. If 
   checked subtitles will appear on screenshots taken with the option
   Video->Screenshot. Otherwise subtitles won't appear on screenshots.

[b]Version 0.2.27[/b]
 * Fixed a problem with the "frame step" option. Sometimes instead of one
   frame it could advance 2 (or more?) frames.
 * Added the option Open->Playlist (it was already possible to open a playlist
   from the Open->File, but well, this way will be easier). A dialog will 
   allow you to open a m3u or m3u8 playlist. The playlist will be loaded and 
   will start to play, but the playlist window won't be opened (not because 
   I wanted that way, just because it was easier...)
 * In fullscreen mode, when you drag the time slider, the "jump to..." message
   will be displayed in the OSD.

[b]Version 0.2.26[/b]
 * Fixed some problems with the new fullscreen mode, so now it's the default.
   Please test it!
 * Added an option who people with wide screens can find useful: 
   16:9 letterbox. If you play for instance a 2.35:1 movie, this option
   will add black borders to fit 16:9. The interesting thing is that subtitles
   will appear in the bottom border.

[b]Version 0.2.25[/b]
 * Made the "experimental fullscreen mode" the default one and delete the
   the old code.
 * Written a new experimental fullscreen mode ;)
   To test it you have to edit the file config.h and change the
   FULLSCREEN_WITH_MAINWINDOW 0
   to
   FULLSCREEN_WITH_MAINWINDOW 1
   and recompile.
   With this option, the fullscreen mode will be made through the main window
   (hiding the menu bar, control widget and status bar)
   In this mode if you move the mouse near the bottom of the screen
   the control widget will be shown, and if you move it near the top
   the menu bar will appear.
   Problem: I couldn't hide everything, two grey lines appear, one on
   the top, the other on the bottom... that's why this option is set
   to 0 by default.
   I hope I can fix it in the future...

[b]Version 0.2.24[/b]
 * Added the Slovak translation by Peter Mendel.
 * Hopefully fixed a compilation error in Qt 4 under linux.
 * The playlist broke in one of the recent changes: items didn't
   start to play from the beginning. Fixed.
 * Now if the shuffle button is ON in the playlist, playing will always 
   start from a random item (not the first).
 * Parse the ID_SUBTITLE_ID tag.
 * Try to call initializeMenus() and updateWidgets() only when needed.
   initializeMenus() seems to be causing problems (crashes) in Qt 4 if
   it modifies the same menu we've just used. Now initializeMenus() is called
   only once the video has started to play, not before. 
   I hope not, but this change may have broken something. Testing needed.
   initializeMenus() is responsible of creating the audio, subtitle, dvd title 
   and chapter switching menus. updateWidgets() is responsible of updating 
   the widgets (like setting the mute button on/off), but also of keeping 
   the menus updated (setting the check mark on activated options).

[b]Version 0.2.23[/b]
 * I've realized that the latest mplayer builds for Windows don't play a dvd
   if the dvd-device ends with "/" (-dvd-device E:/ will fail). The same
   happens with folders (C:/Videos/My DVD/ will fail, C:/Videos/My DVD 
   will work). So now smplayer removes those trailing "/".

[b]Version 0.2.22[/b]
 * Improved support for playing dvds from folders. In order to properly
   identify these dvd folders, I invented a protocol. In mplayer you
   should use something like this: mplayer dvd://1. That would play
   the first title of the dvd. You can use that too with smplayer:
   smplayer dvd://1. But now you can add after it a folder, this way:
   smplayer dvd://1:/tmp/movies/dvd5 (where dvd5 is a directory
   which contains at least video_ts).
   smplayer dvd://2:/tmp/movies/dvd5 will play title 2.
   You can pass the directory only (forgeting the dvd://number)
   smplayer /tmp/movies/dvd5
 * Open->Directory will autodetect if the selected directory contains
   a ripped dvd (currently it only checks if it contains a video_ts) and
   in that case will play the dvd instead of adding the individual files
   to the playlist.
 * Drag&drop also works. You can drag a folder to the main window.
   If it contains a dvd it will play it, otherwise the files
   of the directory will be added to the playlist.
 * Accidentally you can also drag a folder containing a dvd to the
   playlist and it will work.

[b]Version 0.2.21[/b]
 * Playing a DVD from a folder: make things even clearer. Removed
   the stuff in preferences and added "Open->DVD from folder". It'll ask
   you for a directory where video_ts and audio_ts should be (it seems that
   it also work if you select the directory with the *.vob and *.ifo files).
   So now "Open->DVD" will only play real DVDs in your dvd drive.
 * Added a Open->Directory option. It will add the files in the chosen
   directory (not recursively) to the playlist (after clearing it) and start 
   playing the first item. To fix: it will start playing always the first item 
   even if the shuffle button in the playlist is on.

[b]Version 0.2.20[/b]
 * Fixes a silly bug with -brightness 0. I changed -contrast 0 instead of
   brightness...
 * Now subtitles appear on screenshots.
 * It has always been possible to play ripped dvds from hard disc,
   but for making things clearer, I've added in the preferences dialog
   some options to select a directory from hard disc which should 
   contain the video_ts (and audio_ts). 

[b]Version 0.2.19[/b]
 * The brightness issue in mplayer (windows) is giving me a headache.
   Remember: the image is brighter than it should in windows (directx)
   with -brightness 0. As a work-around I set the soft video equalizer
   as default, but that conflicts with others video output drivers as
   gl or directx:noaccel.
   So going back. The soft video equalizer is not the default, and to
   prevent the bright image -brightness 0 will not be used in Windows.
 * Added a new option in preferences: fast audio track switching. This is
   the default. If unchecked, audio track switching will restart mplayer,
   which is a little bit slow, but that should make possible to switch audio
   tracks in containers apart from avi, mpeg and mkv.

[b]Version 0.2.18[/b]
 * Reordered the recent files stuff. I hope this fixed the crash problem
   with Qt 4.
 * Now the default encoding for subtitles is ISO-8859-1 instead of latin1
   (it's the same encoding, just a name change, so it can be found in
   the new encoding list).
 * Renamed the videoequalizer2 to videoequalizer.
 * The inforeader won't wait the mplayer process to finish for ever. It'll
   wait for some seconds and if the mplayer process is not finished then 
   it will kill it. This way if the mplayer process for some reason hangs, 
   smplayer won't do the same.
 * Disable software video equalizer (-vf eq2) when using gl or gl2 as
   video output driver, as they seem to be incompatible.
 * The file passed through the command line is now send to the new open
   function with autodetection of media type. That means that you can
   pass a local file, a dvd (in the form of dvd://1, dvd://2...), a
   playlist (*.m3u or *.m3u8), or stream. 

[b]Version 0.2.17[/b]
 * Added a stereo mode menu, where you can select: stereo, left channel or
   right channel. According to mplayer manpage this seems to be only for 
   MP2/MP3.
 * At last added a "recent files" menu. Currently it shows the 10 recent
   files opened. 

[b]Version 0.2.16[/b]
 * It seems that the new way of changing dvd chapters doesn't work well
   in Windows, so now it's disabled by default but you can activate it
   in the preferences dialog.
 * The shift key is now ignored, and can't be used as modifier for key
   shortcuts.
 * Added in the preferences dialog a combobox to select the encoding
   of the subtitles.

[b]Version 0.2.15[/b]
 * Added in the preferences dialog an option to autosync audio/video.
   This is what the manpage of mplayer says about it:
       -autosync <factor>
              Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based  on  audio  delay  measure-
              ments.   Specifying  -autosync  0, the default, will cause frame
              timing to be based entirely on audio delay measurements.  Speci-
              fying  -autosync  1 will do the same, but will subtly change the
              A/V correction algorithm.  An uneven video framerate in a  movie
              which  plays  fine  with -nosound can often be helped by setting
              this to an integer value greater than 1.  The higher the  value,
              the  closer the timing will be to -nosound.  Try -autosync 30 to
              smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not implement  a
              perfect  audio delay measurement.  With this value, if large A/V
              sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or 2 seconds  to
              settle  out.   This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets
              should be the only side-effect of turning this  option  on,  for
              all sound drivers.
 * Now the info window updates in realtime. And the filename will be
   displayed in smplayer window title.
 * New functions: prev and next chapter (keys ! and @) It should work with
   dvd chapters and matroshka chapters.
 * Now selecting a dvd chapter is much much faster (now mplayer is not
   restarted).
   Note: this new method doesn't work at least with the version of mplayer 
   I'm using (dev-SVN-r21937) if -cache is used in the command line.
   If it happens to you too, the work-around is to set the cache to 0
   in the preferences dialog.

[b]Version 0.2.14[/b]
 * On Windows the option to use the software video equalizer will be
   check by default (when running for first time), as a work-around
   for the bright image problem.
 * As suggested by Amnon82 in the forum, added a menu for selecting
   the number of audio channels (mplayer will try to used the specified
   number of channels, but it will depend on the media). Options are:
     default (the -channels options will not be passed to mplayer)
     stereo (2 channels)
     4.0 Surround (4 channels)
     5.1 Surround (6 channels)
 * Added a debugging message identifying the OS on which it's running
   (currently only linux and windows), the version of smplayer and
   the version of Qt.

[b]Version 0.2.13[/b]
 * Fixed a crash when trying to open a file being created by mencoder.
 * Catch the "Generating Index" message from mplayer and display it in
   status bar.
 * The key shortcuts work in compact mode.
 * Disabled fullscreen mode when another window (playlist, preferences...) is
   open.
 * Added the Options submenu to the popup menu (right click menu).
 * Added key shortcuts for cycling through audio and subtitle tracks:
   audio assigned to key j. subtitle assigned temporary to h.

[b]Version 0.2.12[/b]
 * Using showFullScreen() instead of a normal show() for fullscreen.
 * Compact mode hides the menu bar too. And moved the option from
   the Options menu to the Video menu. Added a key shortcut: Ctrl-C.
   TODO: now it seems that other key shortcuts (like Ctrl-F to open a file)
   don't work in this mode, at least with Qt 3.

[b]Version 0.2.11[/b]
 * Some fixes in the new code for fullscreen. Now (at least in Windows)
   changing to fullscreen mode should be very smooth (no blinks).
 * New info window (Options->View info).

[b]Version 0.2.10[/b]
 * New fullscreen mode. Using now a widget which has a parent instead of
   of a widget with no parent.
 * Added a "compact mode". In this mode, the status bar and the control
   widget are hidden.
 * Added a config.h where you can change some defines which modifies the
   behavior of some things. For instance, "DOCK_PLAYLIST 1" makes the
   playlist to be embedded in the main window.

[b]Version 0.2.9[/b]
 * Just a very small change: when going to fullscreen mode, the function
   Gui::toggleFullscreen was called twice (I think it's because button->setOn 
   emits a signal). Now it's still called twice but now the function checks 
   if there's really something to do.

[b]Version 0.2.8[/b]
 * Hopefully fixed two ancient bugs in Windows: the mplayer log with 
   blank lines and in some menus the accel letter didn't show underlined.
 * Added accels for all options in the menus. Unfortunately this change
   breaks the translations of the menus.

[b]Version 0.2.7[/b]
 * Fixed a bug in Windows. In the playlist, the symbol "/" was
   replaced with "\" in internet streams (mms:\\.... instead of
   (mms://...), avoiding them to play.

[b]Version 0.2.6[/b]
 * Added the postprocessing filter (-vf pp) with autoq. The autoq value
   can be changed in Preferences->Performance. By default: 6 (the highest).
   The postprocessing filter can be selected in Video->Filters->Postprocessing.
   This filter may "improve" the video quality.

[b]Version 0.2.5[/b]
 * The new equalizer was broken in Qt 4. I hope I fixed it.
 * Now when saving a playlist, if you typed a name without extension
   smplayer will add it for you (.m3u).
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.2.4[/b]
 * Replaced the video equalizer with a better looking one.

[b]Version 0.2.3[/b]
 * Load m3u8 files from Open->File (and from command line).
 * Convert strings from mplayer output to unicode from system locale.
   That should allow smplayer to read properly non latin1 text in 
   mplayer output. 
 * Replaced in code all qDebug(...latin1()) with qDebug(...utf8().data()). 
   This way non latin1 characters shouldn't be lost in logs.
 * Now playlist tries to use relative paths when saving the playlist.

[b]Version 0.2.2[/b]
 * When loading a playlist, comments (lines starting with #) are ignored.
 * Now smplayer can load and save m3u8 files (same as m3u but in UTF-8).
 * Rewritten the "remove selected items" code in playlist.
 * Replaced all float's with double's. I hope this hasn't broken anything...

[b]Version 0.2.1[/b]
 * Convert strings from system locale to unicode, in arguments passed
   from command line and when reading (and saving) m3u files.

[b]Version 0.2.0[/b]
 * Now when you add a file or files to the playlist, only the
   filename appears, not the whole path.
 * Added a shortcut for playlist: Ctrl-L
 * Added shortcuts for previous and next in playlist: < and > 
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.1.20[/b]
 * Now if the directory for screenshots is empty, the option 
   -vf-add screenshot will not be passed to mplayer. This lets smplayer
   to work with old versions of mplayer which don't have that filter.
 * More improvements in the playlist: added a play button (will play
   the selected item). Added a popup menu (right click), with 3 options:
   play, remove selected and edit. The last option lets you edit the
   name that will be shown in the playlist for the selected file. 
   With this, I think the playlist is almost finished.

[b]Version 0.1.19[/b]
 * In playlist, the Add->Files and Add->Directory update the last directory
   used for playlist.
 * Added some icons in Preferences dialog.
 * Added icons for playlist's repeat & shuffle buttons (they are ugly: 
   I did them myself...)
 * Added two new buttons in playlist: up and down. You can use them
   to move items up and down in the list.

[b]Version 0.1.18[/b]
 * Now the shuffle option in playlist should work.
 * The playlist saves the state of the repeat & shuffle buttons and
   also the size of the window.

[b]Version 0.1.17[/b]
 * Some fixes in the video equalizer.
 * Now Open->URL remembers the last url.
 * Playlist remembers the last directory used.
 * Some fixes in the spec file.

[b]Version 0.1.16[/b]
 * Added a video equalizer.

[b]Version 0.1.15[/b]
 * If "main window resize method" was "never" and you played an audio file
   and the a video file, the video window didn't show. Fixed.
 * Some other small fixes.

[b]Version 0.1.14[/b]
 * Now the minimum step in sub delay and audio delay is 100 ms (not 200).
 * Now streams can be passed through the command line.
 * Fixed a crash when duration of a file was less than 0.

[b]Version 0.1.13[/b]
 * Playlist accepts drops. Dropped files will be added to the playlist.
 * Added two button to the playlist: repeat and shuffle. Repeat works,
   shuffle not yet.
 * Now the subtitle menu (for *.srt, *.sub...) shows the name of the files
   (was in 0.1.12 but I forgot to mention).
 * Small changes and fixes.
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.1.12[/b]
 * Added a reset button in demuxer / video & audio codec selection. Clicking
   that button will select the original option. Useful if you don't 
   remember which one was it.
 * Changes in fullscreen mode. Now fullscreen is a global setting.
   This allows to view all videos in the playlist in fullscreen mode,
   without switching to window mode everytime a video finished.
 * Also added in the preferences a new option: "Start videos in fullscreen".
   If checked all videos you open will be played in fullscreen.

[b]Version 0.1.11[/b]
 * Added a new dialog for configuring advanced settings for the current
   file. You may type additional options to be passed to mplayer (and
   also video and audio filters). This options are only for the current
   file, and they will be saved among the rest of the file settings.
   That way you could for example, add a crop filter and that filter
   will be used everytime you load that file.
   There's also the possibility of choosing the demuxer, video codec and
   audio codec. Most of the time you won't need them, but in the case
   one file gives you some trouble with the video or audio maybe you can
   fix it by selecting another codec.

[b]Version 0.1.9[/b]
 * Now you can load idx/sub subtitles. Select the *.idx in the open
   subtitle dialog.
 * Updated the German translation.

[b]Version 0.1.8[/b]
 * Now the main window accepts drags. So you can drag a video and it will
   be played. If dragged more than a file, all of them will be added to
   the playlist (the playlist is cleared first).

[b]Version 0.1.7[/b]
 * Well, it was hard to know why the mplayer process had finished 
   (end of file, stopped by user, stopped by the program). Fool of me,
   mplayer says in its output. So now I catch the "Exiting... (end of file)"
   message, so I really hope that the problems that this was giving me
   have fixed for ever.
 * Added support for matroska chapters. In order to work the file MUST
   have the extension *.mkv.
 * Not allow to add repeated files in playlist.
 * Changes in Makefile: now "make install" works.
 * Created a spec file.

[b]Version 0.1.6[/b]
 * Fixed a bug that produced a segmentation fault on startup.
 * Windows/Qt 4: when I file finished playing, playlist wasn't noticed,so
   next file didn't start to play. Fixed (I hope...)
 * Added support for monitor aspect correction.

[b]Version 0.1.5[/b]
 * More improvements in the playlist. Added some icons among other things.
 * Added 3 new buttons in the main window: playlist, previous and next.
 * Updated the German translation.
 * Updated the Spanish translation.

[b]Version 0.1.4[/b]
 * Now you can pass a m3u file from the command line.
 * Playlist: Added options to add files or a whole directory (it will add 
   everything that's there, even non playable files!
   Added options to remove the selected items or to clear the whole list.

[b]Version 0.1.3[/b]
 * Added the German translation (by Henrikx)
 * Some fixes in the playlist

[b]Version 0.1.2[/b]
 * Open->File, if you open a m3u it will passed to the playlist.
 * Now smplayer gets more info about the files (title, artist, album...).
   This is displayed in Options->View info but it's also used for the
   playlist.
 * Now it's possible to add and remove items in the playlist. The add
   button adds the current file loaded by smplayer. The remove button
   removes the selected items.
 * Added an indicator for the file which is playing (currently the 
   indicator is very simple "->", in the future will be an icon).

[b]Version 0.1.1[/b]
 * Changed the version scheme.
 * At last I have learnt how to pass defines to the Makefile created by qmake.
 * Changed the way of getting icons (images.h / images.cpp)

[b]Version 0.1-070208.13[/b]
 * Added to the config file the option initial_volume, which will be
the initial volume when smplayer starts.

[b]Version 0.1-070208.12[/b]
 * Now when a new file is loaded the volume is not changed.
 * Save in playlist works (although it's a little bit useless, there
   are not options to add files to the playlist)

[b]Version 0.1-20070208-2[/b]
 * Rewrite the playlist using a QTable instead of a QListView.
 * For proper installation in linux, the following defines will be
   taken into account:
   DATA_PATH must be set to the directory where the data files (currently
   only input.conf) are installed.
   TRANSLATION_PATH must be set to the directory where translations (*.qm) are
   installed.
   DOC_PATH must be set to the directory where the documentation is installed
   (currently there are no documentation)
   What I don't know yet is how to pass those defines to the Makefile.

[b]Version 070207-12[/b]
 * Started the playlist. Currently is very limited. You can load
a m3u file and it will be played (it must cointain absolute paths). 
Double click on a item plays that file. Streams are also supported.

[b]Version 070206-2[/b]
 * Reduced a little bit the size of button's icons.
 * New action "PLAY_PAUSE" set to MediaPlay key.

[b]Version 070204-12[/b]
 * Fixed a funny bug. Sometimes when a video is about to finish, it started
   to play again from the beginning.
 * Put the basis for configurable key shortcuts.
 * Added some key shortcuts: Alt+1 & Alt+2 change gamma. 
   Ctrl+F = Open->File, Ctrl+U = Open->URL, Ctrl+X = Open->Exit.
   Ctrl+I = Options->View Info, Ctrl+P = Options->Preferences.
 * Added support for multimedia keys: 
   MediaPlay = Pause (and resume Play)
   MediaStop = Stop
   MediaNext = +10 secs
   MediaPrev = -10 secs
   But I don't have a multimedia keyboard, so this is untested...

[b]Version 070202-2[/b]
 * Some changes in the preferences dialog.
 * Added an option to select the Qt style to use.

[b]Version 070201-2[/b]
 * Added an option to select your CDROM drive. This setting is currently
not used for anything, but in the future it will used for playing VCDs.
 * One of the main feature of smplayer is the ability to remember the
settings (audio track, subtitles, filters selected...) of every file
smplayer has opened. Now I have added two options to disable it. One of them
will disable it completely, smplayer will remember nothing. The other
just will make smplayer to not remember the time pos, so every file
will start playing always from the beginning.

[b]Version 070131-11[/b]
 * Added a new page in the preferences dialog: Performance, with the
following options:
  - Priority (only for windows)
  - Allow frame drop (-framedrop)
  - Allow hard frame drop (-hardframedrop)

[b]Version 070131-2[/b]
As expected the ASS color buttons didn't change color in Windows (or Qt 4).
I think now this is fixed.

[b]Version 070130-2[/b]
 * Now you can change the color of the SSA/ASS subtitles.

[b]Version 070129-3[/b]
Arrggg, I've just realized that the volume wasn't remembered. Fixed, I hope.

[b]Version 070129-2[/b]
 * Volume and mute: changing the volume unmutes.
 * Now the time slider should work much better. It should work either
   dragging it or clicking in any part of the bar. Furthermore now
   while dragging it, it displays the time you would go. 

[b]Version 070128-11[/b]
 * Added two new options to the preferences dialog:
   - Use software video equalizer (-vf-add eq2)
   - Use software volume control (-softvol)
 * Now the status bar shows the total time too.
 * More or less fixed a conflict with mute and setting the volume.

[b]Version 070128-2[/b]
 * Fixed a bug with the screenshot feature.
 * Now the video window hides if there's no video (audio only file or
   using the mplayer window).

[b]Version 070127-11[/b]
 * Double click on the video window toggles fullscreen.
 * Added an option to take screenshots. You must set first a directory
 for saving these screenshots, in the preferences dialog.

[b]Version 070127-2[/b]
 * Added two new options to the "Aspect ratio" sub-menu: 
    - 5:4 
    - 16:10 
 * New log window, with buttons to save the log to a file or copy the
 text to the clipboard. 
 * Some fixes in the time slider.

[b]Version 070125-11[/b]

 * Added two new video filters: 
 - Dering 
 - Add noise (which adds a little bit of noise to the image)

[b]Version 070125-2[/b]
* Added some video filters: 
 - denoise (normal) = hqdn3d 
 - denoise (soft) = hqdn3d=2:1:2 (I find the default hqdn3d too strong) 
- deblock = pp=vb/hb

[b]Version 070124-11[/b]
* Now you can scroll through the video by using the mouse wheel. By
default every wheel event will advance +30 or -30 seconds. This value
can be change in the preferences dialog. Setting to 0 disables this
feature.

[b]Version 070124-2[/b]
* Added 3 new options to the preferences dialog: 

- disable screensaver 
- resize method 
- mplayer cache 

Now I think all options in the config file can be set through the
preferences dialog.

[b]Version 070123[/b]
* Some changes in the preferences dialog:

- Now a combobox allows you to select your CD/DVD device. In linux some
usual names are used (/dev/dvd, /dvd/cdrom, etc.). In windows it should
display the drive's letters (C: D: etc) but I haven't tested yet.

- Now the user can choose the video and audio drivers from a list (shows
all available drivers in your mplayer).

[img]http://www.uploadfile.info/uploads/64e14ba167.jpg[/img]

[b]Version 070122-11[/b]
* Found an easier way to change the background color in Qt 4. The
visible change is that now the background in statusbar will be black as
in Qt 3. 
* When clicked with the mouse right button to pop up the context menu,
the main window stopped receiving keyboard events. I hope this is fix
now. 
* Changed some icons.

[b]Version 070122-2[/b]
* Now the screensaver in windows is disabled during playback (the
screensaver is disabled in x11 too since some versions ago). 
* Now the mouse cursor disappears over the video window if it's not
moved for some seconds, and appears again when it's moved.

[b]Version 070121-11[/b]
* The option autoload_sub=false didn't work. Fixed (I hope). 
* Added more options to the preferences dialog. It's a little bit ugly
but all options should work.

[b]Version 070121-2[/b]
* Started to write the preferences dialog. There's a lot of work to do,
but the options that appears in it should work.

The subtitles' page is almost complete!

[img]http://www.uploadfile.info/uploads/f57fc459d3.jpg[/img]

[b]Version 070119-2[/b]
* Well, I removed that horrible logo I made the other day and now I used
some icons from
[url=http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=31585]Vista-Inspirate[/url].
* Some new options for the [preferences] section in config file:

[b]resize_method=(int)[/b]

This options controls the way the main window should resize. The possible values are:

0 : the main window never resizes. The user is the only one allowed to
resize the window.
1 : the main window resizes every time it's needed (this is the
default).
2 : the main window resizes only after loading a new video, but not
after restarting mplayer. That means that if the user resizes the
window, the new size will be respected (until a new video is loaded).


[b]mplayer_additional_options=(string)[/b]

Here you can pass other options to mplayer. The options should be
separated by spaces. If a option requires a filename, this should NOT
contain spaces.

Example:
mplayer_additional_options=-flip -softvol

Be carefully, some options could interfere with the ones smplayer uses.

[b]mplayer_additional_video_filters=(string][/b]

Here you can add additional video filters. They should be separated by
",". Don't use spaces!

Example:
mplayer_additional_video_filters=hqdn3d,pp=vb/hb


[b]mplayer_additional_audio_filters=(string][/b]

The same but for audio.
Example:

mplayer_additional_audio_filters=volnorm,equalizer=11:11:10:5:0:-12:0:5:12:12

* I also made a (incompatible) change in the way the file preferences
are stored in the config file. That means that this version won't
remember your previous file settings.

[b]Version 070117-12[/b]

* Well, I think the only visible change is the option Options->View
info, which shows some info about the current video. 
* There are some changes in the configuration file (~/.qt/smplayerrc): 

vo=(string) 

vo is the video output driver. It already existed before. But now I
change the default value. Previously the default value was "directx" for
windows, "xv" for the rest. 

Now there is no default. If vo is empty, smplayer would get the info
from mplayer, and will save it in the config file. 
That (theorically) would allow smplayer to run in other OS where maybe
"xv" doesn't even exist. 

Added the option 
ao=(string) 

audio output driver, with the same behavior of vo. 

And finally, added the option subcp, which allows to select the font
encoding for subtitles.

[b]Version 070117-2[/b]
* Fixed a bug when parsing the A: V: line. Big big numbers weren't read
correctly.
* Added some options for the configuration file:

font_autoscale= (int)
font_textscale= (int) 

use_fontconfig= (bool)
font_name= (string)
font_file= (string)

font_autoscale and font_textscale are the equivalents to
-subfont-autoscale and -subfont-text-scale in mplayer.

If use_fontconfig is true then the font used for subtitles will be
font_name. Example:

use_fontconfig=true
font_name=Utopia

In the case use_fontconfig is false, then it will try to use font_file
(which has to be a full path to a ttf font). Example:

use_fontconfig=false
font_file=/home/ricardo/.fonts/comicbd.ttf

So now you can get something like this:
[img]http://www.uploadfile.info/uploads/c2e06dd51a.jpg[/img]

Of course, all of this will be easier when I write the preferences
dialog.

[b]Version 070116-2[/b]
* Added options for changing playback speed.

[b]Version 070115-1[/b]
* Just a very small fix with the mute option. It wasn't been remebered
between mplayer resets and audio track switches.

[b]Version 070114-2[/b]
* Fixed (I hope) a bug relative to subtitles. smplayer didn't remember
that you had selected the "none" subtitle and always loaded the first
available subtitle. Now, when you load a video for first time it will
load the first available subtitle but if you change to "none" it should
remember the next time you open the same video. 
 
* Added and option to select angle in DVDs. Unfortunately I don't have a
multiangle dvd, so this option is untested. Can anyone tell me if it
really works? 
  
* For audio, chapter, title and angle menus: added an <empty> item if
the menu is empty.

* Added a button to mute. And two nice icons borrowed from kplayer...
