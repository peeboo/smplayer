A feature that has been repeatedly asked is at last available in version
0.4.15: configurable key shortcuts.

Here it's a brief explanation.
The actions editor is located in Preferences->Mouse & keyboard. There
you'll see a table with all actions.

There are 4 columns. The first one will be used to display warnings if
there are repeated shortcuts.
The 2nd one shows the current shortcut, which you can change.
The 3rd column shows the description. This is normally the text that
appears in menus. Maybe some descriptions, without their menus, aren't
very clear, so I added in column 4 the internal name of the action.


How to change a shortcut:
This is different if you use Qt 3 or Qt 4.

With Qt 3 it's very easy. Just click on the shortcut cell, and now press
the key (or combination of keys) that you want to be the new shortcut.
And the name of the key will appear. To delete a shortcut, right click
with the mouse and choose "Clear".

With Qt 4 it's no so easy. Double click on the shortcut cell you want to
change, and then edit the shortcut text as a normal text.
Setting a shortcut for key "A" or "F4" is easy, but maybe you can't
figure out the name of all keys (specially if your language is not
English). Here (http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/qt.html#Key-enum) you can
see the list of key names in Qt (you have to type what is after "Qt::Key_")
BTW, the name of the Enter key is actually "Return".

When you click on the Ok or Apply buttons, the new shortcuts will be
used (and saved to the configuration file). On the the hand if you
select Cancel all changes will be lost.

It's also possible to save the list of shortcuts to a file (with
extension "keys"), and load it later (what you really save or load
is the current contents of the edition table).

The *.keys files are just plain text. Each line has two fields separated
by a tab: the action name, and the shortcut.
